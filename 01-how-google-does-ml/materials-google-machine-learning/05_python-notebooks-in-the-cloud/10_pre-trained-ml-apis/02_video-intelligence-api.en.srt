00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Cloud Video Intelligence is an API that lets you understand your videos entities at shot,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,910
frame, or video level.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,470
Let's see what you can do with the Video Intelligence API.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,065
First, the video API lets you do label detection,

5
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:16,905
which tells you what's in this video and it does this in two ways.

6
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:19,645
At a high level, it'll tell you what is your video about,

7
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,255
and in a more granular level,

8
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,820
it can tell you what's happening in every scene of your video.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,540
The API also lets you do Shot Change Detection.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,490
So, for example, if your video changes from

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,085
a landscape pan to a close up of a person doing an interview,

12
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:36,660
it will give you the time stamps every time the camera changes shots.

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,480
It also lets you do Explicit Content Detection.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,480
This can identify inappropriate scenes in your video.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,795
And finally, the video API supports Regionalization,

16
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:50,530
which lets you specify the region where your video API requests should be executed.

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,755
The best way to see how the video API works is through a live demo.

18
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:56,710
Let's take a look. Here, we have

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,660
a Superbowl commercial for Google Home and

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,430
I'm just going to play the first couple seconds of the video.

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,318
We can see here at the video has a lot of scene changes.

22
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:09,680
It started with the mountain pass then it moved to a city street.

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,703
Now we see a dog and then a garage.

24
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:13,975
You get the idea.

25
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:16,145
If we were to have to manually classify this video,

26
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:17,955
we need to watch the entire thing,

27
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:19,955
write down what was happening in each scene,

28
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,565
and then store these tags in a database somewhere.

29
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:26,580
With the video API, we can do this with a single REST API call.

30
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,055
If we look below the video,

31
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:32,780
we can see a visualization of the JSON response we get back from the video API.

32
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,730
It knows there's a dog in the video and it knows

33
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,750
exactly which seconds the dog can be found.

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,325
It also knows there's a birthday cake at the end of the video.

35
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:44,695
If we scroll down,

36
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:47,165
we can see some more of the labels that are returned.

37
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:52,420
We can see it's able to identify the exact breed of dog from that opening scene,

38
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,995
and it's even able to identify the mountain pass from the beginning.

39
00:01:56,995 --> 00:02:00,955
This is what the video API can do with one video,

40
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:04,275
but you likely have more than one video that you want to analyze.

41
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:06,960
Let's say, you're sports media company and you've hours of

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,335
sports footage but you want to create a highlight reel of only your baseball videos.

43
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:13,275
Doing this manually would take hours.

44
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:18,260
With the video API, this is easy using the JSON response you get back.

45
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,710
I have a library of videos here with a number of

46
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,180
sports videos and I want to find only my baseball clips.

47
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,620
I'm going to search my library for baseball, and boom.

48
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,140
We see that the video API is immediately able to

49
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,045
identify which of our videos contain baseball.

50
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:39,215
It's also able to identify where in these videos we can find baseball clips.

51
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:40,465
This is my favorite example,

52
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:42,660
this is the year end search video that Google publishes

53
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,180
at the end of every year highlighting top searches.

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,240
It's obviously got a lot of different types of clips in it.

55
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,060
It only has one or two seconds that contain a baseball clip.

56
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,420
With the video API, we're able to jump right to that point in the video.

57
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,680
This is from 2016,

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,715
when the Cubs won the World Series.

59
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:01,530
So let's do one more search.

60
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,325
Let's find all of the Android clips in our video.

61
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:14,040
Here, we can jump to all the points in our videos where an Android phone is present.

62
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,100
We can see that what used to take hours,

63
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,130
now takes minutes or seconds with the Video Intelligence API.
