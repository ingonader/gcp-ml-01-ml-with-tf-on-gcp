00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Cloud Speech is an API that lets you perform speech

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,090
to text transcription in over 100 languages.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,775
Let's see everything you can do with the Speech API.

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,405
So, at its core, the Speech API lets you pass it an audio file,

5
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:15,660
and it returns a text transcription of that file.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,155
It also supports speech timestamps.

7
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:20,475
So, what this will do is it'll return the start and

8
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:23,595
end time for every word in your audio transcription,

9
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:26,700
which makes it really easy to search within your audio.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,660
It also supports profanity filtering and in addition,

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,255
the API let's perform either batch or streaming transcription.

12
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:35,655
So, you can send it a complete audio file,

13
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:38,475
or you can also send it a continuous stream of audio,

14
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:42,630
and it will return transcriptions as that audio stream comes in.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,240
I want to show you a demo that focuses on

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,955
the speech timestamps feature and before we see the demo,

17
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:49,615
I'm going to explain how it works.

18
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:51,505
The first thing I did when building this demo,

19
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:54,229
was I extracted audio from a few videos.

20
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:58,940
Then I sent those audio files to Cloud Speech for transcription and time stamps,

21
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,655
and I built a UI to visualize and search within those video transcripts.

22
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:05,724
Let's take a look.

23
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:08,510
So, here we have a video of Moore's talking about

24
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,910
GCP pricing and below the video we

25
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,880
can see a transcript which is returned from the Speech API.

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,980
I made it so that you can click on any word in

27
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,545
the transcript and jump to that point in the video.

28
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,938
So, for example if we click here,

29
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:24,315
we can go right to that moment in the video.

30
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:28,141
We can do the same over here.

31
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:31,970
So, this is what you can with speech timestamps for one video,

32
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,820
but you likely have a large video library and you might want to

33
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,735
search for a specific audio snippet within that library.

34
00:01:38,735 --> 00:01:42,300
So, I've got a couple of videos here and let's say I want to

35
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,400
find all the mentions of Firebase across my video library.

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,430
I'll search for firebase and I

37
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,430
can easily see all the points in these two videos were firebase is

38
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:00,356
mentioned and I can jump right to those points in the videos.

39
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:03,867
In this video there is only one mention of firebase.

40
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:05,195
So, if I was reviewing it manually,

41
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:07,100
there's a chance I might miss this.

42
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,870
With the Speech API's timestamps feature,

43
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,375
I'm able to jump right to this point.

44
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:16,480
I encourage you to try out the Speech API on your own directly in

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,149
the browser at cloud.google.com/speech.

46
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:25,195
With Cloud Speech, we saw how we could take an audio file and transcribe it into text.

47
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:26,375
Once you've got that text,

48
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,640
you might want to do further analysis on it.

49
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,200
One thing you might want to do is translate

50
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,395
it and that's where a Cloud Translation comes into play.

51
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:36,500
Cloud translation exposes the functionality of Google Translate to

52
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,535
developers so you can implement similar functionality into your own applications.

53
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:45,085
It's an API that lets you translate text into over 100 different languages.

54
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:47,980
Let's see what you can do with Cloud Translation.

55
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,075
So, the API lets you translate text,

56
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:53,300
and it also can simply let you detect the language of your text.

57
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,430
So, if you have a text box where users could be

58
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,755
entering text in a variety of different languages,

59
00:02:57,755 --> 00:03:02,450
you can simply use the detect language method to detect the language of that text.

60
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,000
You can try it out in the browser at cloud.google.com/ translation.
