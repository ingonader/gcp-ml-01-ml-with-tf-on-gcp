1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
In this Lab, you will clone

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,395
the GitHub repository of the course within your Datalab instance,

3
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:07,465
and save it all in your project.

4
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:12,465
And then, you can work with a notebook to try out the machine learning APIs.

5
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:18,275
As before, the Labs often have you simply run through a workout example.

6
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:21,755
Because we cannot help you personally debug your code,

7
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,690
we're choosing to do it this way.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,270
To make sure you understand what is being done though,

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,855
try changing the code and see if you understand the impact of those changes.

10
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:37,705
Ultimately, remove the code from a critical section of the notebook.

11
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:42,693
The critical sections are often pointed out in the challenge sections of the Labs,

12
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:45,415
and see if you can write the code yourself.

13
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:47,155
And if you get stuck,

14
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:49,000
look back at the solution.
