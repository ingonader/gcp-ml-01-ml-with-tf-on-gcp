Remember that we said Data Lab is
a way to try things locally, but then scale it out to the cloud
using managed services. At Google we may have invented MapReduce,
but by 2006 people were not using it anymore. Papers and MapReduce and GFS led to
the open source implementations, hadoop and HTFS. But meanwhile Google is moving on
because we're realizing that writing convoluted MapReduce code and maintaining
and managing clusters was hard. So we developed better ways to do things. Dremel, for example,
is essentially SQL queries, and Colossus is a file system that allows
extremely high throughput reads. Dremel and Colossus are often on
Google Cloud platform as BigQuery and Google Cloud storage so that you can use Google second
generation of our big data stack. Of course, it's not just Google. The entire industry has recognize this and that's why you're seeing
a third wave of cloud. Where the second wave of cloud was about
rented infrastructure, similar to what we did in the previous lab, the third wave
of cloud is about fully elastic services. The second wave of cloud is great if you
want to migrate your legacy applications. But for new projects,
use the third wave of cloud immediately. Use managed services, because managed
services gives you standard ways of doing things using open source software without
having to worry about infrastructure.
