So, in my quick demo, you saw that I was able to query large data sets interactively in an ad hoc manner. My query itself was SQL:2011, a standard. Getting data into BigQuery is quite flexible. You can use anything from uploading files, from the web GUI to staging them on cloud storage, and pointing at them to streaming data into BigQuery. You can export from BigQuery quite easily because of the varieties of APIs. Run a SQL query and save the result in the format that you want. Storage is also quite cheap. And finally, key for our purposes, Datalab integrates nicely with BigQuery, so we can explore data, run a query, export into a Pandas DataFrame and plot it using Python. In fact, that's exactly what you're going to do.
