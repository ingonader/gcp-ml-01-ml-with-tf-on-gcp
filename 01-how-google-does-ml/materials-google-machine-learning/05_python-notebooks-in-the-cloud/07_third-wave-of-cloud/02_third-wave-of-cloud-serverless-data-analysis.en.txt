man: But that's just
a bunch of words. What does it mean in practice? So here I am
on the BigQuery console. BigQuery is a data warehouse. And here I'm basically
gonna be querying a public data set
of Medicare claims, and I'm looking
at Medicare claims in 2014. This is an ad hoc query,
so I did not create indices. I did not prepare the database
to make this query efficient or anything like that. This is an ad hoc query. I'm just gonna be running it
on this particular data set, grouping it by state and ordering it
by the total claim count. So what you're gonna find out
is which states in the U.S. had the most number of claims. So let's go ahead
and run this query. And we just processed
276 megs of data, and that's because BigQuery's
a columnar database and we just processed
a couple of columns. And about 3 seconds later, we get back that California had
the maximum number of claims, and Florida had the next
higher amount of claims. Notice the claim amounts--
they're in the millions. This particular table-- Let's go ahead and look at it. It's in BigQuery public data. So, in BigQuery public data,
it's in Medicare. And part D, prescriber 2014. This particular data set has about 24 million rows. So we were able to do
an ad hoc query on a data set that's about 24 million rows in a matter of seconds. And we were able to do this without provisioning
any virtual machines, installing any software. We just ran the query. This is what we mean
when we say "third wave cloud." We're talking
about fully managed services that auto-scale for you, that all that you need to do
is to write some code and have it be executed
by managed infrastructure.
