1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,350
Remember that we said Data Lab is
a way to try things locally, but

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,020
then scale it out to the cloud
using managed services.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,770
At Google we may have invented MapReduce,
but

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,430
by 2006 people were not using it anymore.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,665
Papers and MapReduce and GFS led to
the open source implementations,

6
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:19,751
hadoop and HTFS.

7
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:24,480
But meanwhile Google is moving on
because we're realizing that writing

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,270
convoluted MapReduce code and maintaining
and managing clusters was hard.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,860
So we developed better ways to do things.

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,280
Dremel, for example,
is essentially SQL queries, and

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,160
Colossus is a file system that allows
extremely high throughput reads.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,600
Dremel and Colossus are often on
Google Cloud platform as BigQuery and

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,340
Google Cloud storage so

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,970
that you can use Google second
generation of our big data stack.

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,080
Of course, it's not just Google.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,970
The entire industry has recognize this and

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,920
that's why you're seeing
a third wave of cloud.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,870
Where the second wave of cloud was about
rented infrastructure, similar to what we

19
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,930
did in the previous lab, the third wave
of cloud is about fully elastic services.

20
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:18,050
The second wave of cloud is great if you
want to migrate your legacy applications.

21
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,950
But for new projects,
use the third wave of cloud immediately.

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,640
Use managed services, because managed
services gives you standard ways of doing

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,930
things using open source software without
having to worry about infrastructure.
