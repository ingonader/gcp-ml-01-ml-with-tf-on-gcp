1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:02,733
man: But that's just
a bunch of words.

2
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:05,433
What does it mean in practice?

3
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:09,067
So here I am
on the BigQuery console.

4
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:12,633
BigQuery is a data warehouse.

5
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:15,900
And here I'm basically
gonna be querying

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,567
a public data set
of Medicare claims,

7
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:21,767
and I'm looking
at Medicare claims in 2014.

8
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:24,733
This is an ad hoc query,
so I did not create indices.

9
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:29,067
I did not prepare the database
to make this query efficient

10
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:30,400
or anything like that.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,900
This is an ad hoc query.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,567
I'm just gonna be running it
on this particular data set,

13
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:37,233
grouping it by state

14
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,733
and ordering it
by the total claim count.

15
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:44,067
So what you're gonna find out
is which states in the U.S.

16
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:45,933
had the most number of claims.

17
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:48,233
So let's go ahead
and run this query.

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,900
And we just processed
276 megs of data,

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,233
and that's because BigQuery's
a columnar database

20
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:02,567
and we just processed
a couple of columns.

21
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:05,067
And about 3 seconds later,

22
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:08,733
we get back that California had
the maximum number of claims,

23
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:11,733
and Florida had the next
higher amount of claims.

24
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:14,400
Notice the claim amounts--
they're in the millions.

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,067
This particular table--

26
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:17,567
Let's go ahead and look at it.

27
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,900
It's in BigQuery public data.

28
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:26,233
So, in BigQuery public data,
it's in Medicare.

29
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:33,900
And part D, prescriber 2014.

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,567
This particular data set

31
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:38,700
has about 24 million rows.

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,067
So we were able to do
an ad hoc query on a data set

33
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:45,067
that's about 24 million rows

34
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:46,733
in a matter of seconds.

35
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:48,900
And we were able to do this

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,567
without provisioning
any virtual machines,

37
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:53,567
installing any software.

38
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,067
We just ran the query.

39
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:58,400
This is what we mean
when we say "third wave cloud."

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,733
We're talking
about fully managed services

41
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:02,567
that auto-scale for you,

42
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:05,067
that all that you need to do
is to write some code

43
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:07,567
and have it be executed
by managed infrastructure.
