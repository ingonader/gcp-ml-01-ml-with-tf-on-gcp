1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,525
Hello, and welcome again to the course.

2
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:04,340
Before we get too deep into the lectures here,

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,790
I want to preview the interactive hands-on labs platform called Qwiklabs,

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,670
and how you're actually practicing a lot of the things that you're going to learn here,

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,975
inside of a real Google Cloud Platform accounts,

6
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:16,825
but you don't need your own credentials as they're actually going to be provided for you.

7
00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:19,210
So, let's take a look at how the labs platform is setup.

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,845
Inside of Coursera, you're actually going to see

9
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:25,415
a lab or an item that's marked out for an external tool to open up,

10
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:27,145
and you're going to click on that tool.

11
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:30,410
After that, you're going to see it Start Lab button in green and

12
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,845
a timer associated with it for you to complete the lab in that duration.

13
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:35,745
After you click that Start Lab,

14
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:39,380
credentials for your student accounts are automatically going to be provided to you,

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,150
and then new box is going to pop up.

16
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,875
In addition, there's going to be another button that says Open Google Console,

17
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,015
in yellow, and once you open that up,

18
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,650
that's going to ask you to log into the Google Home platform,

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,710
with the key caveat that you logged in with

20
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,240
a student account and not your own personal account,

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,005
should you already have one setup.

22
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,270
Last but not least, we'll do a few demos and

23
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,615
walk-throughs of what the UI looks like. So let's take a look.

24
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:03,960
So, inside an example Coursera course,

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,400
you're going to come across a lab that looks something like this.

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,120
This is just an examples, this is lab zero,

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,955
but it could be any of the labs that you might find.

28
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:12,555
Once you've clicked on that,

29
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:15,410
you'll see a checkbox that's going to

30
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,540
authorize the lab to run and you accept the terms and conditions for Coursera,

31
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,425
and you click on Open Tool.

32
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:22,930
Once you click Open Tool,

33
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,070
that's going to bring you to the Qwiklabs environment

34
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,580
and a couple of key things to notice here.

35
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,050
On the right hand side is your instructions pin for the actual lab.

36
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,770
This lab is a meta lab, it's all about Qwiklabs in general,

37
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,215
but whatever your course is,

38
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:38,460
this is where the instructions for completing the lab are going to take place.

39
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,070
So you always want to keep this prompt open.

40
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,695
Now, once you actually click Start lab,

41
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:47,960
a provisioned instance of the Google Cloud Platform complete with

42
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,880
any additional instances or say you're working with VMs,

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,550
if there's something that the lab provider wanted you to have,

44
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,985
it's actually going to be created inside of this lab instance for you,

45
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,170
which is a great sandbox instance.

46
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,820
Now, once you notice I click Star Lab,

47
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,710
I have 15 minutes to complete this lab,

48
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,750
I promise you that the timers are going to be associated

49
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,045
with additional padding for the labs that are going to do.

50
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,620
This is going to mean it gets to take 15 minutes,

51
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,130
this will take us within about five minutes.

52
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,740
Now, as I mentioned before,

53
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,815
you have the username and password and a Project ID.

54
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:19,620
What I'll ask you to do now is click on Open Google Console,

55
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,480
and once you've opened Google Console you'll be asked to sign in with your email.

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,320
Now, the key thing here is if you use Google resources before,

57
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,985
immediately you'll start typing in your personal email, I do it all the time,

58
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:32,885
make sure you go back to your lab credentials screen

59
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:35,260
and copy and paste the username that's auto-generated for use.

60
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,070
It's going to be unique for you and it's

61
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,140
actually going to be unique for every lab that you run,

62
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,930
so you'll be creating a new student account for each lab that you run.

63
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,120
Copy and paste that password, it's going to be different from mine,

64
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,855
so don't worry about copying that down.

65
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:49,220
Click Next in your browser,

66
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,170
paste in that password, accept the terms.

67
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,620
Don't worry about setting up a secondary phone number.

68
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,960
Accept the terms of the Google Cloud Platform,

69
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,535
and once you see a screen that looks like this, then you're good to go.

70
00:03:06,535 --> 00:03:10,905
Make sure, key tidbit is this is your project's selector,

71
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:14,305
it should be this auto-generated Qwiklabs alphanumeric.

72
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:17,150
If you should happen to see something that says either select

73
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,535
the project or if you see something that says Qwiklabs resources,

74
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:23,480
you actually want to click on this and make sure to

75
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,155
select your alphanumeric Qwiklabs ID and then go ahead and hit open.

76
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:29,145
Once you're within here, you're good to go.

77
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:30,870
So, follow the instructions for the rest of the lab,

78
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,000
it's going to guide you through

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,195
what products and services that you're going to be working with.

80
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:37,805
You can access the menu of products and services in the upper left hand corner here,

81
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:40,030
or if it's a lab that's working with CloudShell,

82
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,710
all the way up here is the button to activate CloudShell,

83
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,920
which will bring open that terminal instance for Google Cloud Platform.

84
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,605
Last few things.

85
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:50,825
Back here you'll see that our timers automatically running still.

86
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:52,700
Once you're completed with a lab,

87
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,570
you're done with it or if you wanted to take another attempt at the lab,

88
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,230
you have upwards of three attempts per lab which is great.

89
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,550
So, say you want to run through the lab very quickly the first

90
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,100
time and then experiment and explore with it the second time,

91
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,280
you're welcome to do that for a couple of times.

92
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,000
Now, make sure in order to get your completion stats properly recorded,

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,385
click on End Lab.

94
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,095
You'll be faced with a prompt that says, "Are you all done?"

95
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:15,415
Once you click End Lab,

96
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:17,275
your project, any datasets,

97
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:18,800
anything that you've been working with inside of

98
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,600
this sandbox project is going to be deleted.

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,870
So, make sure if you have any queries that you're running or

100
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,860
any interesting notes that you have saved inside of

101
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,050
your Google Cloud Platform, Qwiklabs account,

102
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,095
that you copy and paste those and save them somewhere else,

103
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:33,905
perhaps in your own personal Google Cloud Platform account

104
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:35,710
or somewhere locally on your machine.

105
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,595
Once you've clicked End Lab,

106
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:40,130
then you can enter feedback for the lab and you

107
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,515
can continue moving on with rest of the courses in Coursera.

108
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,720
So again, quick recap,

109
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,900
one of the key things to remember is click on Open Tool,

110
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,375
that'll open up Qwiklabs.

111
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,430
The second is, in order to get those credentials here on the left hand side,

112
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,905
you have to click Start Lab which again kicks off the timer,

113
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:56,480
and there's no way to pause when once the lab is started,

114
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,590
but again keep in mind you have multiple attempts.

115
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,890
Lastly, click on End lab when you're ready

116
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,550
to complete out the lab that you've been working on.

117
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,250
That's it. Good luck with the labs that come later on, and enjoy the course.
