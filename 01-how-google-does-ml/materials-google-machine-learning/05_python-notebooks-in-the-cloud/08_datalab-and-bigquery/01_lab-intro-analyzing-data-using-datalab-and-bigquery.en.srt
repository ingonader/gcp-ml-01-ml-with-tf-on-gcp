1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,265
In this Lab, you will get to employ a very useful pattern.

2
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:09,405
You will use BigQuery to calculate useful aggregates,

3
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:13,580
percentile values, and the like over 70 million rows.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,140
The result will go into a Pandas DataFrame of a dozen rows.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,020
You can then happily use that in-memory Pandas DataFrame for visualization.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,200
So, this is the kind of thing that would take you hours if you did it any other way.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,105
However, in the Lab,

8
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:33,500
you will create the graphs in seconds.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,135
It's important to get this kind of interactive development workflow done.

10
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:43,150
Otherwise, you will not be able to work with large datasets easily.

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,415
Well, you might think that you don't have to work with all of the data.

12
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:50,575
You can simply sample the dataset and work with a smaller sample.

13
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:54,955
However, that is a bad practice in machine learning.

14
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,990
One thing I like to say is that

15
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,815
the key difference between statistics and machine learning,

16
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:02,045
is how we deal with outliers.

17
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:05,425
In statistics, outliers tend to be removed.

18
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:07,100
But in machine learning,

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,255
outliers tend to be learned.

20
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:11,245
And if you want to learn outliers,

21
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:14,080
you need to have enough examples of those outliers,

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,775
which essentially means that you have to work with all of your data.

23
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:21,150
You have to have the distribution of outliers,

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,285
distributions of rare values throughout your dataset.

25
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,795
And in order to do that,

26
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,125
you have to work with your complete dataset.

27
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,660
One way to do this,

28
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,695
is to do what you're going to do in this Lab,

29
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:36,665
which is to use managed services like BigQuery,

30
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:39,055
to process data at scale,

31
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:44,915
and then bring it back into more familiar in-memory structures like Pandas,

32
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:49,105
and then use tools like the plotting libraries in Python.

33
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:54,320
So, this is a common working paradigm that we have to get familiar with.

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,080
And you will learn how to do this in the
