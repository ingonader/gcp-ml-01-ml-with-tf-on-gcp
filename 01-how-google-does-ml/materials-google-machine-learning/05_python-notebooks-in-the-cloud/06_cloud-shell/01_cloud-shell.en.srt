1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,670
What we just did here was to go ahead and create a computer engine in VM.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,025
Just for the purposes of branding a few scripts.

3
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:10,560
This is hugely wasteful.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,070
You don't actually have to do that.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,190
And let me show you something really cool.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,950
If you go to the GCP console,

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,795
you'll see this little icon here that says,

8
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:20,915
"Activate Google Cloud Shell."

9
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:22,710
So, go ahead and click on that.

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,425
And what you'll get is something called Cloud Shell.

11
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:28,470
And Cloud Shell is a micro VM.

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,625
It's a really small tiny VM.

13
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:34,200
But it is usually enough for our purposes if all

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,650
we want to do is to go ahead and try out a few things,

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,970
run a few scripts,

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:49,235
copy a few files over from one location to another.

17
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:51,335
So, here we are in Cloud Shell,

18
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:53,495
and I can essentially go ahead and do

19
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:57,170
pretty much the same kinds of things that it did on the computer engine VM.

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,175
Except, that Cloud Shell is meant for developers.

21
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:06,260
So, many of the things that we actually had to go install on the computer engine VM,

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,415
we don't need to do that here.

23
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:10,935
So, for example, Git. Already there.

24
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:12,500
So, if you want to go ahead and get Git,

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,990
I would just say Git clone.

26
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,500
And go ahead and clone a repository. And there we go.

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,770
We now have all of the code that we needed to have,

28
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,270
and we can go ahead and do much of our lab that we did in computer engine.

29
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,305
We could just go ahead and do it in Cloud Shell.

30
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:41,290
Now, the thing about Cloud Shell is that it's a very ephemeral VM.

31
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,620
If you're not using it,

32
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,785
usually in under an hour, it gets recycled.

33
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:48,300
But then you can always go ahead and start another Cloud Shell.

34
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,990
You can get another tab in the Cloud Shell.

35
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,120
This is still the same VM,

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,520
but you now have two tabs in it.

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,875
And you can run other commands in this tab.

38
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:05,150
So, we will be using Cloud Shell as a way to do things like starting data lab.

39
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,000
It's something that you're going to do in the next lab.
