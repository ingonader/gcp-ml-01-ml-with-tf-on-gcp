What we just did here was to go ahead and create a computer engine in VM. Just for the purposes of branding a few scripts. This is hugely wasteful. You don't actually have to do that. And let me show you something really cool. If you go to the GCP console, you'll see this little icon here that says, "Activate Google Cloud Shell." So, go ahead and click on that. And what you'll get is something called Cloud Shell. And Cloud Shell is a micro VM. It's a really small tiny VM. But it is usually enough for our purposes if all we want to do is to go ahead and try out a few things, run a few scripts, copy a few files over from one location to another. So, here we are in Cloud Shell, and I can essentially go ahead and do pretty much the same kinds of things that it did on the computer engine VM. Except, that Cloud Shell is meant for developers. So, many of the things that we actually had to go install on the computer engine VM, we don't need to do that here. So, for example, Git. Already there. So, if you want to go ahead and get Git, I would just say Git clone. And go ahead and clone a repository. And there we go. We now have all of the code that we needed to have, and we can go ahead and do much of our lab that we did in computer engine. We could just go ahead and do it in Cloud Shell. Now, the thing about Cloud Shell is that it's a very ephemeral VM. If you're not using it, usually in under an hour, it gets recycled. But then you can always go ahead and start another Cloud Shell. You can get another tab in the Cloud Shell. This is still the same VM, but you now have two tabs in it. And you can run other commands in this tab. So, we will be using Cloud Shell as a way to do things like starting data lab. It's something that you're going to do in the next lab.
