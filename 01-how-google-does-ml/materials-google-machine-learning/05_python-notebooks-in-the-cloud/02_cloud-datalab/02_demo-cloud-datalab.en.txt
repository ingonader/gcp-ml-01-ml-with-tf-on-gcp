So this is what Datalab looks like. Datalab is a Jupyter Notebook,
it plays where you can go and run Python, Bash, etc. So for example, I'll be in this cell,
that's a code cell, and I might type in some Python code. x=5, y=x+5, and print y, and
if I run it I basically get the output. And something as simple as
this is a power of a notebook. The output of the program is
embedded along with the code itself. I can also go ahead and add a mark down. I can say here for example,
here is a title, And some text. And when I run it I basically
get a mark down, right? So the idea is that you have code,
you have outputs, you have commentary,
all in the same notebook. One of the things that you will often
do is when you're running notebooks is that you might go ahead and
clear all the cells, and at which point all of the outputs go away. And then you can also go ahead and
say Run all Cells, and then every one of the cells
basically gets executed. So this is the typical working
process with the Datalab notebook
