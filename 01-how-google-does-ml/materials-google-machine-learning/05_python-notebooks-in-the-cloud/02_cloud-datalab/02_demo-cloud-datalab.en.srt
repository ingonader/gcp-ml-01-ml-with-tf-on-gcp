1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,070
So this is what Datalab looks like.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,907
Datalab is a Jupyter Notebook,
it plays where you can go and

3
00:00:05,907 --> 00:00:08,050
run Python, Bash, etc.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,530
So for example, I'll be in this cell,
that's a code cell, and

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,345
I might type in some Python code.

6
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:17,191
x=5, y=x+5, and

7
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:22,410
print y, and
if I run it I basically get the output.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,340
And something as simple as
this is a power of a notebook.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,210
The output of the program is
embedded along with the code itself.

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,530
I can also go ahead and add a mark down.

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:43,410
I can say here for example,
here is a title, And some text.

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,080
And when I run it I basically
get a mark down, right?

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,860
So the idea is that you have code,
you have outputs,

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,120
you have commentary,
all in the same notebook.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,380
One of the things that you will often
do is when you're running notebooks

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,690
is that you might go ahead and
clear all the cells, and

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,470
at which point all of the outputs go away.

18
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,890
And then you can also go ahead and
say Run all Cells, and

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,740
then every one of the cells
basically gets executed.

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,950
So this is the typical working
process with the Datalab notebook
