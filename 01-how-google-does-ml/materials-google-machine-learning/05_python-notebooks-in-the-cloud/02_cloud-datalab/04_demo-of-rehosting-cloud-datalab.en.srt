1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,020
So let's say you've been
working with Datalab and

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,320
you're running Python code, and
you realize you need more memory.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,470
What do you do?

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,940
Well, one of the things that you can do
is you can simply rehost the notebook.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,310
So here for example, I'm on the web
console and I see that there is

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,780
a mydatalabvm, this is the virtual
machine that's actually running Datalab.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,060
I can go ahead and select this VM,

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:28,029
stop it And at this point,
the VM has been stopped.

9
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:41,420
And once a virtual machine is stopped,
we can change its machine type.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,978
Notice that at this point,
the earthquake VM is running,

11
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,790
whereas the mydatalabvm is stopped.

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,110
And I will go ahead and click on the
mydatalabvm and click on the Edit button.

13
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:01,510
And at this point, I can change
the machine type from 1 virtual CPU with

14
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:08,220
4 gigs of memory to have 4 CPUs with
15 gigs of memory, for example.

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,751
And having done that,
I can then basically go ahead and save it.

16
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,440
At this point, the Datalab VM,
it now has more CPUs but it still stopped.

17
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,570
And if it stopped, I'm not paying for
it other than for the disks, etc.

18
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,783
I'm not paying for
the computer associated with it.

19
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:46,839
When I'm ready to start it up again,
I will go ahead and

20
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,790
select this and start it.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,740
And at this point,

22
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,546
the darker image that's going to be
running Datalab will also get started.

23
00:01:55,546 --> 00:02:00,965
So one this VM is up, I will have Datalab
running, but this time, the Datalab

24
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:04,950
is going to be running in a virtual
machine that is a lot more powerful.

25
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,325
And when I'm done with it,
I can go ahead and stop the machine,

26
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:10,247
because I'm not using it anymore.

27
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:12,757
Or I could also stop the machine and

28
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:18,110
bring it back down to a less powerful
instance, and fire it up again.

29
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,480
So this is a very easy way to go ahead and

30
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,920
rehost your Datalab notebooks if you
ever need notebooks running on machines

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,660
that are of different powers because
you need them for different projects.

32
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,802
More commonly though, we will just
run our Datalab machine on any

33
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:40,190
one standard one VM, just the basic
plain vanilla virtual machine.

34
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,950
Because what you're going to actually be
doing is that most of the work that you

35
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:50,170
want to do is going to get done in
serverless managed services on the cloud.

36
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,730
So whether we are doing data exploration
or we are doing machine learning,

37
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,600
we will just submit the job and have it
be carried out on hundreds of machines.

38
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,630
So we are not going to be really concerned
about running Datalab on a slightly more

39
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,675
powerful machine.

40
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:07,463
Why bother with a slightly
more powerful machine,

41
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:10,380
when you can get hundreds of machines?
