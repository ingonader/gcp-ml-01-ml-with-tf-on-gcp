00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
Do you use IPython or Jupyter notebooks today?

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,190
Increasingly, data scientists work in self-descriptive,

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,670
shareable, executable notebooks whenever

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,445
they want to do data analysis or machine learning.

5
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:18,780
Datalab is based on Jupyter and it's open source.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,290
So, this is what the interface to Datalab looks like.

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,960
Notice how there are chord sections interleaved with markup and output.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,345
This interleaving is what makes the style of computing so useful.

9
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:38,975
Data analysis and machine learning are commonly carried out in notebooks like this.

10
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:41,460
You can execute the code by either clicking

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,020
the run button or by pressing shift and enter.

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,997
Notice that the output here isn't just command line output,

13
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:53,190
it's charts as well.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,955
The red section contains markup so you can explain why you're doing what you're doing,

15
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:02,570
and one of the green sections there contains

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,785
a button for exporting the notebook as a standalone file.

17
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:10,800
The other green section is what you'd click if you wanted to

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,115
commit your changes to a code repository on Google Cloud platform.

19
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:21,000
In this lab, we'll show you how to pull from and commit to code repositories.
