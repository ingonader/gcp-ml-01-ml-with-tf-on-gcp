Do you use IPython or Jupyter notebooks today? Increasingly, data scientists work in self-descriptive, shareable, executable notebooks whenever they want to do data analysis or machine learning. Datalab is based on Jupyter and it's open source. So, this is what the interface to Datalab looks like. Notice how there are chord sections interleaved with markup and output. This interleaving is what makes the style of computing so useful. Data analysis and machine learning are commonly carried out in notebooks like this. You can execute the code by either clicking the run button or by pressing shift and enter. Notice that the output here isn't just command line output, it's charts as well. The red section contains markup so you can explain why you're doing what you're doing, and one of the green sections there contains a button for exporting the notebook as a standalone file. The other green section is what you'd click if you wanted to commit your changes to a code repository on Google Cloud platform. In this lab, we'll show you how to pull from and commit to code repositories.
