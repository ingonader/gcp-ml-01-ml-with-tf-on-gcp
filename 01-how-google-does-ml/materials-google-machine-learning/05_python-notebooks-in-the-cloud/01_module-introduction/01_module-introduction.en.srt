1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,700
Let's now talk about

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,010
the development environment you will use throughout the specialization.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,245
We are going to be talking about Python notebooks in the cloud.

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:15,580
We will learn how to develop machine learning models in Python notebooks,

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,930
where the notebook server is on the cloud,

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,385
and we'll also learn how to execute ad-hoc queries using serverless technologies,

7
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:26,695
and do this from those Python notebooks.

8
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:30,900
Not every machine learning model needs to be built from scratch.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,795
So also in this module,

10
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:38,415
my colleague Sarah will show you how to invoke pre-trained machine learning models.

11
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:41,120
Cloud data lab is basically

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,520
the integrated development environment you will be

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,720
using to write your code in this course.

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,420
Cloud data lab notebooks run on virtual machines.

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,790
And because of that,

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,345
we will talk about Compute Engine and cloud storage.

17
00:00:55,345 --> 00:01:01,105
Why? Two things follow from the fact that cloud data lab runs on a VM.

18
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:04,980
First, it means that you can actually control and

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,845
change what sort of machine is running your notebook,

20
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:12,950
by for example giving it more memory or adding

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,390
a GPO without having to rewrite your notebook from scratch.

22
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,755
Re-hosting a notebook on a more powerful machine is trivially easy.

23
00:01:22,755 --> 00:01:27,180
Second, virtual machines are ephemeral.

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,865
Consequently, anything that you want to persist,

25
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:32,640
anything that you want to save,

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,330
you must store outside of the VM.

27
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:43,005
And the best place to do that especially for a large binary files is in cloud storage.

28
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:46,110
So after reviewing how Compute Engine works,

29
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,615
we'll review the basics of Cloud Storage.

30
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:51,510
The notebooks themselves we will store in

31
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,190
a cloud repository so that they're under revision control.

32
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,945
Finally, we'll do a hands-on lab so that you can get hands-on with data lab.

33
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:04,675
We'll show you how to use cloud data lab together with BigQuery,

34
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:10,070
which is a managed data analysis service on the cloud that will allow you to execute

35
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,970
ad-hoc queries at scales and speeds that are

36
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,155
not possible with traditional database systems.

37
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:20,780
And then we will look at how to invoke pre-trained ML models,

38
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,000
and do this from within cloud data lab.
