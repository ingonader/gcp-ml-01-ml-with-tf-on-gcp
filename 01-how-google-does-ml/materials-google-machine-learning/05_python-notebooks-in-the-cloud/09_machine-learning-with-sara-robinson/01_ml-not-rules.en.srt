1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
Many tasks are impossible to solve without machine learning.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,850
But let's take a step back for a moment and see how you would

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,255
classify these images without a machine learning model.

4
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:11,220
So if we were to write an algorithm to classify

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,742
these images probably a series of if statements,

6
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:15,495
what are some things we might look for?

7
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:17,835
If you thought about color, you're on the right track.

8
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:20,790
So we could look at the color of the pixels and image.

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,100
If the majority of the pixels in the image are red,

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,495
we would output apple is the classification.

11
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:27,420
If the majority of the pixels were orange,

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,040
we would output orange.

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,000
This would work really well in this example.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,150
But what if the images were varied slightly?

15
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,310
What if we had gray scale images?

16
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,230
Then we would need to look for a different feature.

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,295
Maybe the presence of a stem or the texture of the image.

18
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:42,750
So we need to start writing our algorithm again to

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,105
output accurate classification for these images.

20
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:49,700
What if we got crazy and added a third fruit to the equation?

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,950
What if we added a mango? You get the idea.

22
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,620
Then we'd have to start our classification algorithm all over again.

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,905
But these images are all pretty similar.

24
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:00,090
They're all circular. They're all fruits.

25
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,755
So if we had two images that we wanted to classify that looks nothing alike,

26
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:05,900
the classification task should be pretty simple.

27
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,985
So what if we had images of a dog and images of a mop?

28
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:13,490
This should be really easy to classify, right?

29
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,285
The dog is living and breathing.

30
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:17,660
The mop has no eyes, nose or mouth.

31
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,675
So this should be a relatively easy classification task.

32
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:24,520
But you'll find that this is actually pretty difficult.

33
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,870
Here we have four photos of sheep dogs and four photos of mops,

34
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,775
and it's kind of hard even for the human eye to distinguish between the two.

35
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:35,030
So you get the idea, we don't want to write specific code to

36
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,840
identify every possible type of thing we might see in our images.

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,005
Instead, we want to write code that will find these rules for us.

38
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:43,595
We might not just have images.

39
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:47,390
We might have other types of unstructured data that we want to classify as well.

40
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,805
So what I want to talk about today is two ways

41
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:53,630
the Google Cloud platform can help you add machine learning to your applications.

42
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,740
On the left-hand side, we have tools to help you build custom machine learning models.

43
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,430
TensorFlow is an open source library provided by the Google Brain team

44
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,770
that lets you build and train your own machine learning models using your own data.

45
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,035
If you want to run TensorFlow models and manage Google infrastructure,

46
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:12,915
we have a tool called Cloud machine learning engine to help with that.

47
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:15,230
What I want to focus on today is the right-hand side,

48
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,430
and this is what I like to call friendly machine learning.

49
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,815
These are a set of pre-trained APIs to give you access to

50
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:26,125
pre-trained machine learning models with a single rest API requests.

51
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:30,930
I'm going to be talking about each of the APIs in detail along with some live demos.
