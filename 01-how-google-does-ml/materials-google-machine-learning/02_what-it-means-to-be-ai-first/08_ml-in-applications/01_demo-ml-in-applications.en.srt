1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
An easy way to add machine-learning to your applications,

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,310
is to take advantage of pre-trained models.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,580
These are off-the-shelf solutions.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,630
Cases that you don't need to build your own models.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,780
Aucnet is the largest real-time car auction service in Japan.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:23,755
Serving over 30,000 dealers and running auctions worth nearly 4 billion dollars a year.

7
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:26,915
And the way it used to work was that car dealers would

8
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:30,260
take multiple photos of each used car to sell,

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,105
upload them to the service,

10
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:37,970
and need to specify what model of the car and what part of the car for every photo.

11
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,750
It's a time consuming task for the dealers to do across thousands of photos every day.

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,810
And now, the new machine-learning system

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,265
can detect a model number of the car at high accuracy.

14
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:53,120
It can also show the estimated price range for

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,570
each model and recognizes what part of the car is being photographed.

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,630
With this system, the car dealers just drag and drop a bunch of unclassified photos,

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,065
and then check of the model and parts are classified with the system correctly.

18
00:01:08,065 --> 00:01:12,110
So let's see how the Aucnet website works.

19
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,700
So here's an example of what the website looks like,

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,950
you can basically go ahead and upload images of a car.

21
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,430
So, at this point we're uploading some photographs that we've taken of a car.

22
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,470
And what we're going to see is that

23
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,820
the system is going to take all of these images and catalog them.

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,580
It's going to basically find which photographs are from the front of a car,

25
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,890
which are of the side of the car etc.

26
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,565
It's also going to identify the brand of the car and use

27
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:46,125
those as inputs to come up with an evaluation of what this car might be worth.

28
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:50,860
So here it is, you see that we uploaded a photograph of a truck,

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,490
and it said this is the front of the truck,

30
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,795
here is a right side of the truck,

31
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:55,495
the right side front.

32
00:01:55,495 --> 00:02:00,870
I didn't upload the photograph of the rear or of the left side rear,

33
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,820
but I did have one image of the front tyre and it's all there.

34
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,570
So I basically went ahead and put in all of those images in

35
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,170
the appropriate slots and set at first guess

36
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,460
96 percent confident that this is a Toyota Land Cruiser.

37
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,775
Just notice how much easier this is.

38
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:26,135
Rather than the human user having to upload a whole bunch of information,

39
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:28,330
typing a whole bunch of information into a form.

40
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,515
All that they're doing now is uploading a bunch of photographs,

41
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:33,685
and the system is cataloging them,

42
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:37,645
identifying what the model of the car is,

43
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:41,070
and being able to go ahead and get them further

44
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,000
along in the process of listing their car for sale.
