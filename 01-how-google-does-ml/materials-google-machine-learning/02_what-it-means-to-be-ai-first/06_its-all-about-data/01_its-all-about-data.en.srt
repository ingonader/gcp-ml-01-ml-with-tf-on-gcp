1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,115
So, how does this change the way we approach new problems?

2
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:09,355
A few years ago, we found that certain types of queries were becoming more common.

3
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:11,635
Japanese toys in San Francisco,

4
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:13,745
live lobster in Kissimmee,

5
00:00:13,745 --> 00:00:16,295
vegan donuts near me.

6
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:19,375
These are hard queries, local queries.

7
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,865
People are not looking for websites,

8
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:24,930
but actually businesses on a map.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,100
Well, we could write rules for each of these,

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,160
but it becomes unwieldy rather quickly.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,675
So, let's see how we approach it from a machine learning perspective.

12
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:39,810
We start by thinking about how to collect the data to make it

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,060
an ML problem. Let's look at an example.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,020
The query, coffee near me.

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,170
The idea behind machine learning is to take a bunch of

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,915
examples and convert that knowledge into future predictions.

17
00:00:55,915 --> 00:01:00,170
When you search for "coffee near me," what

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,300
are the examples that you are collecting that you're converting into knowledge?

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,475
What is the future prediction?

20
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:10,665
The prediction is quite straightforward.

21
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:12,215
There are two options.

22
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:15,820
Bill's Diner carries coffee and it's only three minutes away.

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,760
However, there's a gourmet coffee shop just two minutes more.

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,215
And we rather think you'd prefer the coffee shop to the sandwich shop.

25
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:27,570
On the other hand,

26
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,825
if the gourmet coffee shop is across the bridge,

27
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:33,940
we probably will send you to the diner instead.

28
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,500
Or if the diner typically takes 10 minutes to serve

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,210
coffee or doesn't have takeaway coffee so that you have to sit down and eat,

30
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,380
then perhaps a 15-minute walk is what you'd prefer.

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,360
How far is too far?

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,920
How much is the rating of the restaurant and the time it takes to serve you?

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,900
How much do all of these matter?

34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,560
Rather than guessing and having a whole bunch of rules,

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,960
we'd rather have users telling us.

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,140
So, we look at a bunch of data and do a trade-off.

37
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,760
Distance versus quality of coffee,

38
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,610
service time versus quality of coffee, etcetera.

39
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,620
But let's now just consider distance.

40
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,105
Where do you get this data?

41
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,285
As an AI-first company,

42
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:22,175
we might start with heuristics,

43
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,760
but we do so with the mindset that we're going to throw away

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,095
the heuristics just as soon as we have enough data about user preferences.

45
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:34,010
What we need are examples.

46
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,820
Remember, example equals labelled data.

47
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,440
Here, the input is the distance to the shop and

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,670
the label is "Does the user like the result or does he not?"

49
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,700
So, we take an example of a shop one kilometer away and the user says,

50
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,289
"Great, I'll go one kilometer for a great coffee."

51
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:01,668
And then we ask another user whether they'd go three kilometers and they say,

52
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:04,300
"I don't even like gourmet coffee."

53
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,180
So, we aggregate a bunch of different examples

54
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,380
until eventually we realize it's so far away that nobody wants to go.

55
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,007
And then, we try to fit our model.

56
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:19,485
So, machine learning is about collecting the appropriate data

57
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:25,370
and then finding this right balance of good learning and trusting the examples.
