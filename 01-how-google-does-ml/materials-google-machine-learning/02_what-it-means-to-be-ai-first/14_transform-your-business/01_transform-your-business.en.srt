1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,645
So fulfill user intent,

2
00:00:02,645 --> 00:00:07,040
using email creatively, so as to delight the users.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,315
The ability to have machine learning to scale, to be personalized,

4
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:13,670
gives you lots of opportunities,

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,370
to use ML creatively and delight your users.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,840
For ML to be magic,

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,255
you should keep in mind the word delight,

8
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:26,190
delight your users, anticipate their next need.

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,035
Did the card get canceled?

10
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:29,600
Did the flight get delayed?

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,530
Etc, or did they just walk into your store and see an empty shelf?

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,840
Why are they contacting you?

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,810
Did your system automatically find the right action to take for this customer?

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,655
Did it offer to re book them?

15
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:45,495
Offer them a meal voucher,

16
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:49,580
suggested you're happy they're wearing your brand of sneakers.

17
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:55,235
Understand the context, that your user is working with them,

18
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:58,085
and anticipate their next need.

19
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:02,429
So fulfill user intent in interesting ways,

20
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,505
using capabilities of ML.

21
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:09,900
For example, users want background music in their videos,

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,475
but using popular songs is a copyright violation, solution?

23
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:19,535
What if you generate music according to their specs,

24
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:23,600
if they say they want a climax two and a half minutes in,

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,585
and they want music in a jazz style,

26
00:01:27,585 --> 00:01:30,225
why don't you go ahead and generate that music,

27
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:32,815
and use that as a background for your videos.

28
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:36,505
That's not possible with machine learning.

29
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:43,410
So your business can benefit from machine learning, three ways,

30
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,790
one infuse your applications with machine learning,

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,890
simplify the user input,

32
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,870
adapt to the user.

33
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,695
Second, use machine learning to fine tune your business,

34
00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:57,350
to streamline your business processes,

35
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,455
maybe even create new business opportunities,

36
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:04,700
and finally, use machine learning to delight your users,

37
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,240
anticipate their needs, and use machine learning to

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,000
creatively fulfill what the user intended to do.
