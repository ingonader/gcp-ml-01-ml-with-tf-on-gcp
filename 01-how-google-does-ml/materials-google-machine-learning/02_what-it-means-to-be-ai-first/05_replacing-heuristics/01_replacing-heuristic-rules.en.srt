1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,610
We looked at machine learning and said that it was a way to

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,195
derive repeated predictive insights from data.

3
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:12,065
Then, we talked about the two stages of ML, a training phase,

4
00:00:12,065 --> 00:00:15,595
where you teach the algorithm using labeled examples,

5
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:18,775
and a prediction or inference stage,

6
00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:22,920
where you use a trained model to make inferences and new data.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,715
We then looked at a few examples of machine learning in action,

8
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:29,495
photos, translate, Smart Reply,

9
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:31,330
all from Google products.

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,390
So, how do you get to the point where

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,330
your company is innovating like this in machine learning?

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,870
Our execs had a unique answer to the question

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,345
of what kinds of problems can machine learning solve.

14
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:52,805
This is Eric Schmidt, the Executive Chairman of the board at Google.

15
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:56,815
He's talking about the new transformation going on at Google,

16
00:00:56,815 --> 00:01:00,370
where we're becoming an AI-first company.

17
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,805
"Machine learning," says Eric,

18
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:04,890
"This is the next transformation.

19
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,740
The programming paradigm is changing.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,010
It's not programming a computer.

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,020
You teach a computer to learn something and then it does what you want."

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,835
Now, this seems strange.

23
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:21,950
When you say ML to most people,

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,605
they think predictions from data,

25
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:31,190
but notice that there's nothing in Eric's quote about data.

26
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,440
He's talking about machine learning as a way to replace programming.

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,460
ML, according to Eric,

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,875
is about logic, not just about data. What does he mean?

29
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,600
Consider search. This is,

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,830
of course, our flagship application here at Google.

31
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,215
If you're typing "Giants",

32
00:01:55,215 --> 00:02:03,970
should we show you the San Francisco Giants or the New York Giants? How would you do it?

33
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,430
A few years ago, this is how Google search worked.

34
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,790
There were a bunch of rules that are part of

35
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,615
the search engine code base to decide which sports team to show a user.

36
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:19,705
If they're query is giants,

37
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:21,750
and the users in the Bay Area,

38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,575
show them results about San Francisco Giants.

39
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:27,180
If the user is in the New York area,

40
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,005
show them results about New York Giants.

41
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:31,985
If they're anywhere else,

42
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,600
show them results about tall people,

43
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,460
and this is just for one query.

44
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:42,130
Multiply this by the large varieties of queries that people make,

45
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,120
and you can imagine how complex the whole code base have become.

46
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,750
The code base is getting unwieldy because handwritten code,

47
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,470
hand-coded rules are really hard to maintain.

48
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,070
So, why not to try machine learning?

49
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:03,260
Machine learning scales better because it's automated.

50
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,120
We knew when we showed people results which of the links they actually clicked on.

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,150
So, how about training a machine learning model so that it could do the search ranking?

52
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,220
That was the essential idea behind RankBrain,

53
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,970
a deep neural network for search ranking.

54
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,260
It outperformed many human built signals.

55
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,345
We could replace many of the hand-coded rules with machine learning.

56
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:36,815
And the neural network ended up improving our search quality dramatically,

57
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:43,880
plus the system could continually improve itself based on what users actually preferred.

58
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,430
Replacing heuristic rules by ML,

59
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,875
that's what ML is about.

60
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:56,175
So, what kinds of problems can you solve with ML?

61
00:03:56,175 --> 00:04:01,300
Answer, anything for which you are writing rules today.

62
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,705
It's not just about predictive analytics.

63
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:08,940
Google Search is not a predictive analytics application,

64
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,260
but we use machine learning for it.

65
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:18,445
Notice that saying that machine learning is a way to replace rules,

66
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:20,100
notice that this is

67
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,920
a far more expansive answer to what kinds of problems can machine learning solve.

68
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,505
So, that's what we mean when we say Google is an AI-first company.

69
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:33,900
We think of machine learning as a way to scale,

70
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,540
to automate, to personalize.

71
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,115
Think about all the heuristic rules you're coding up today.

72
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:42,945
Provided you can collect the right data,

73
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:46,785
you may be able to do it using machine learning.

74
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:52,225
The way you think about problems changes when you do this,

75
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,800
you don't think about coding up rules,

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,335
you think about training models based on data.

77
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:03,035
You don't think about fixing bug reports by adding your rules.

78
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:07,865
You think in terms of continuously training the model as you get new data.

79
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:13,580
And instead of thinking about applying specific rules to specific inputs,

80
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:20,000
you instead think in terms of deploying models at scale so that you can make predictions.
