1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,335
So, pick two use cases from the following two slides,

2
00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:06,040
use cases that you're somewhat familiar with,

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,845
and you're going to cast this in three different ways.

4
00:00:09,845 --> 00:00:13,370
First, cast it as a machine learning problem,

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,365
what is being predicted,

6
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:17,140
what data is needed.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,305
Second, cast it as a software problem.

8
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:24,430
What is the API for the problem during production?

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,265
Who will use the service?

10
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:28,275
How were they doing it today?

11
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:32,845
And finally, cast it in the framework of a data problem.

12
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:35,910
What are some key actions to collect,

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,445
analyze, predict, and react to the data or predictions?

14
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:47,270
Remembering that different input features might require different kinds of actions.

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,810
So, here is a first set of potential use cases.

16
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,340
Freeze this frame of the video and pick a problem to work on,

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:04,555
whether it's in manufacturing or it's in retail or it's healthcare and life sciences.

18
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:12,110
Here is the second set of use cases again freeze the video and pick a use case to

19
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,760
work on whether it's travel and hospitality or

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,775
financial services or energy and utilities.

21
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:23,045
Having done that having picked the two use cases,

22
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:29,170
switch over to the lab and take some time to answer the questions in the lab.

23
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,390
Go to the student forums,

24
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,295
discuss your answers with other students and then when you're done,

25
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,330
also check out my answer to these questions.
