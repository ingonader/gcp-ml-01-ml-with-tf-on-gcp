1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
So, in my case,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:07,410
one of the use cases I picked was demand forecasting in manufacturing.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:15,630
So, first, we cast it as a machine learning problem and asked what is being predicted.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,275
Well, because we're doing demand forecasting in manufacturing,

5
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:27,030
what is being predicted is how many units of widgets X should be manufactured this month.

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,990
For example, if you're making phone display panels,

7
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,430
how many phone display panels of

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,440
a four inch screen or a six inch screen should we manufacture this month?

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,600
So that is what is being predicted.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,460
So when we cast it as a machine learning problem,

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,900
the next question is,

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,575
what data do we need?

13
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:50,120
Well, if you want to be predicting how many units

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,725
of that widget to manufacture, what data do we need?

15
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:58,535
Well, we need historical data on the number of units sold,

16
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:00,800
how many units did we sell last month,

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,960
how many units did we sell the month before, et cetera.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,800
We also need to know the price that it was sold at,

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,505
the number of units that were returned,

20
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:13,880
the price of any competitor product out there,

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,610
and the number of units of all items that use widgets X.

22
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,370
So if you're making phone display screens,

23
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,055
how many smartphones are sold regardless of

24
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:30,895
which display panel they carried or whether it was ours or our competitors?

25
00:01:30,895 --> 00:01:35,270
We will also need other data like economic figures,

26
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,535
customer confidence, interest rate,

27
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:40,425
what happened this month,

28
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:43,870
last year et cetera.

29
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:50,445
The second framing is as a software problem.

30
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:53,060
What is the API of the service?

31
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,240
Well, the method in the API could be predicted demand,

32
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,410
and what does it take?

33
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:06,395
The inputs might be the widget ID and the month that we want to do this prediction for,

34
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:11,095
with the default value for the month being the current month.

35
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:14,570
Notice that in this API,

36
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,065
we are only asking for the widget ID and the time.

37
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:20,275
We are not asking for

38
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:24,980
all those other ancillary data that our machine learning model needed.

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,325
We're not asking the end user to give us how many smartphone units were sold last month.

40
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:35,885
That is something that we would have to collect ourselves.

41
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:41,635
Next part of the framing as a software problem is who's going to use the service.

42
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:44,700
And because is the demand forecasting thing,

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,830
we might think that the users might be product managers,

44
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,235
might be logistics managers, et cetera.

45
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:52,020
How are they doing it today?

46
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,605
They examined trends of phone sales,

47
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:57,840
overall economy, trade publications,

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,480
and they somehow make a decision.

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,155
The third framing is as a data problem.

50
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:09,285
So what kind of data do we need to collect?

51
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:11,700
The things that we need to collect,

52
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,495
A, for training are all the data,

53
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,500
but for also for prediction,

54
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,110
we need to collect all the data except for the data

55
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,835
that we can expect the end user to give us.

56
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,020
So what data do we need to collect?

57
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,170
We need to collect the economic data, the competitor data,

58
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:32,035
the industry data, data from our company itself.

59
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:35,080
And what data do we need to analyze?

60
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,470
Well, we need to analyze all these datasets so that we can craft

61
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:45,010
features that our experts are looking at today from this data,

62
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,690
and we need to take those features and use them as inputs to our model.

63
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,150
And what is our reaction?

64
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,920
How do we react to a prediction of demand?

65
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,920
One way that we could do reaction might

66
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,340
be that if we predicted that demand is going to increase,

67
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,925
we automatically go ahead and put out

68
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:11,385
orders to our suppliers for more of the things that they provide to us.

69
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,000
So the reaction might be automatic.
