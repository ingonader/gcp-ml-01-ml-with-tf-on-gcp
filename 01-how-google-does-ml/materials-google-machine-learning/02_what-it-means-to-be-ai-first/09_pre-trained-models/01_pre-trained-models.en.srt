00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
Artnet built a custom image model on Google Cloud platform using TensorFlow,

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,010
there on the left-hand side of this image.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,210
But increasingly, you don't have to do that.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,860
There are a variety of domains where Google

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,340
exposes Machine Learning Services train but our own data.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,190
For example, if you want to transcribe speech,

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,660
you could use a speech API instead of having to collect audio data,

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,820
train it, and predict with it.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,160
There are many such pre-train models.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,395
And such pre-train models are excellent ways to replace user input by machine learning.

11
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:39,630
Here's an example of using a pre-train model.

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,005
Ocado is a world's largest online only grocery.

13
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:45,743
It's based in the UK.

14
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:47,010
And the way it used to work,

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,050
was a customer sended email.

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,900
And traditionally, each email would get

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,990
read and then routed to the appropriate E-department,

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,960
where it would get read again.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,045
So that doesn't scale.

20
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:03,100
So, Ocado turned to natural language processing.

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,310
And they were able to extract the sentiment of the email and entities,

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,455
the things being talked about in the email,

23
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:12,600
and even the syntax of the email.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,165
And this computational technology helps Ocado parse through the body of emails and

25
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:23,010
tag and route these e-mails to help

26
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,650
the contact center reps determine the priority and context in a very efficient way.

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,800
But increasingly, customers do not want to go to your website and click on a button.

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,780
They do not want to send you an email.

29
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,020
They want to talk to you, interactively.

30
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,635
To get their questions and concerns answered.

31
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:46,890
Manually, answering each call doesn't scale,

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,130
and so Gartner estimates that in a few years,

33
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:56,415
we will be spending more on conversational interfaces that even on mobile apps.

34
00:01:56,415 --> 00:02:00,080
So does this mean using the speech API,

35
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,665
transcribing the speech, and then trying to make sense of it?

36
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:06,920
No. What I'm showing you here is

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,085
a high-level conversational agent tool called Dialogflow.

38
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:14,355
So look here at this screen and we notice that the agent says,

39
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:15,820
"How may I help you today?"

40
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,215
And the customer says,

41
00:02:18,215 --> 00:02:20,505
"I want to get a pizza with bacon and cheese."

42
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:21,710
And based on that,

43
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,360
Dialogflow goes ahead and builds

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,605
a JSON message that says that the customer wants to order a pizza,

45
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:32,985
and is able to go ahead and add the toppings corresponding to bacon and cheese.

46
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:35,190
And then the agent says,

47
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,490
"Well, what size do you want?"

48
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,150
Because that's another requirement and based on that,

49
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:47,755
the size as large also gets added and the standard crust and then says, "Oh add olives."

50
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:50,875
And now, into the toppings, olives gets added.

51
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:55,420
Notice that is a very conversational interface and from these conversations,

52
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:01,640
a JSON structured message gets built and it's this JSON message,

53
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,840
this very structured message that goes to

54
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,361
the rest of the application which works the same way as before,

55
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:13,030
except that the user input has not come from the customer pointing

56
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,245
and clicking their way through a platform but

57
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:18,000
instead has come through a conversational interface.
