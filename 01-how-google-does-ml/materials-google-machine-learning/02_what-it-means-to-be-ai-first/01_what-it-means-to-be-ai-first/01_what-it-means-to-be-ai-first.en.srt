00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
A very common question I get;

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,810
What is the difference between artificial intelligence AI and machine learning?

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,500
One way to think about it is that AI is a discipline,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,290
sort of like physics.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,580
AI has to do with theory and methods, in this case,

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,140
about the theory and methods to build machines that think and act like humans.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,470
Machine learning on the other hand is a toolset,

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,370
sort of like Newton's laws of mechanics.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,675
And just as you can use Newton's laws to figure out how long it'll

10
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:38,160
take for a ball to fall to the ground If you drop it off a cliff,

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,170
you can use machine learning to solve certain kinds of AI problems.

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,110
The basic difference between machine learning and other techniques in AI,

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,195
for example expert systems,

14
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:53,570
is that in machine learning, machines learn.

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,000
They don't start out intelligent, they become intelligent.
