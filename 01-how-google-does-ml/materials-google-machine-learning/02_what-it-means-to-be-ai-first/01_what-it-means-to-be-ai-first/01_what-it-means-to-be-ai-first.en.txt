A very common question I get; What is the difference between artificial intelligence AI and machine learning? One way to think about it is that AI is a discipline, sort of like physics. AI has to do with theory and methods, in this case, about the theory and methods to build machines that think and act like humans. Machine learning on the other hand is a toolset, sort of like Newton's laws of mechanics. And just as you can use Newton's laws to figure out how long it'll take for a ball to fall to the ground If you drop it off a cliff, you can use machine learning to solve certain kinds of AI problems. The basic difference between machine learning and other techniques in AI, for example expert systems, is that in machine learning, machines learn. They don't start out intelligent, they become intelligent.
