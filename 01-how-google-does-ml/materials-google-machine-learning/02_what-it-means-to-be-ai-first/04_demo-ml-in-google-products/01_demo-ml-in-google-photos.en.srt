1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
But back to the Google experience,

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:07,750
you have probably used one or more of our 4,000 models.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,720
I talked about how deep learning has come a long way in

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,780
the past few years and nothing illustrates that better than Google Photos.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,850
This is the Google product where you can upload photos from

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,240
your camera to the cloud and you don't need to tag it.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,690
The ML software tags images for you so that you can then find images. Let me show you.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,125
So I'm going to go to photos.google.com and type in Ladakh.

9
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:40,575
Ladakh is this beautiful place in the Tibetan plateau that I went to a few years ago.

10
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:44,665
Let me go ahead and type in Ladakh and you notice

11
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:49,695
that Google Photos brings me back images from 2011,

12
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:53,760
and it basically finds the beautiful Ladakh Valley.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,515
It goes ahead and finds a Buddhist monastery in Ladakh.

14
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:04,565
Interestingly enough, it even finds Himalayan peaks that I photographed on the way there.

15
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:09,870
And I had not gone ahead and tagged any of these images as being Ladakh,

16
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,670
it just happened to be in the cloud.

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,080
It's part of my photos album and I'm able

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,420
to go ahead and retrieve these photographs simply by saying,

19
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,000
show me all the photographs I took in Ladakh. Pretty amazing.
