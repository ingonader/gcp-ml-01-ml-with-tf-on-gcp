But back to the Google experience, you have probably used one or more of our 4,000 models. I talked about how deep learning has come a long way in the past few years and nothing illustrates that better than Google Photos. This is the Google product where you can upload photos from your camera to the cloud and you don't need to tag it. The ML software tags images for you so that you can then find images. Let me show you. So I'm going to go to photos.google.com and type in Ladakh. Ladakh is this beautiful place in the Tibetan plateau that I went to a few years ago. Let me go ahead and type in Ladakh and you notice that Google Photos brings me back images from 2011, and it basically finds the beautiful Ladakh Valley. It goes ahead and finds a Buddhist monastery in Ladakh. Interestingly enough, it even finds Himalayan peaks that I photographed on the way there. And I had not gone ahead and tagged any of these images as being Ladakh, it just happened to be in the cloud. It's part of my photos album and I'm able to go ahead and retrieve these photographs simply by saying, show me all the photographs I took in Ladakh. Pretty amazing.
