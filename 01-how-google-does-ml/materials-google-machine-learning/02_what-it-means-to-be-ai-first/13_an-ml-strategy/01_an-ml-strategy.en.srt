1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
If there's one thing I want you to take away from this module,

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,810
it is that the magic of machine learning comes with quantity, not complexity.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,955
Many small machine learning models,

4
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:15,890
each of which are simple.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,720
So think of a map's example.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,435
So if you're building many machine learning models,

7
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:25,610
and planning for many more that you may never build,

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,400
you want to have an environment where you fail fast.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,915
The idea is that if you're failing fast,

10
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:34,350
you get the ability to iterate.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,315
This ability to experiment is critical in the realm of machine learning.

12
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:46,000
So you want to fail fast and iterate so that you can try a lot of new ideas,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,450
and that way, get a lot more successes.

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,830
Now when I say a data,

15
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,045
most people immediately think structured data,

16
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:56,305
as in data in a database.

17
00:00:56,305 --> 00:01:00,420
But 90 percent of enterprise data is unstructured.

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,915
Think emails, video footage, texts, reports,

19
00:01:04,915 --> 00:01:08,170
catalogs, fashion shoots, events,

20
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,515
news, you name it.

21
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:12,010
All unstructured data.

22
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,010
Dealing with unstructured data has gotten

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,475
a lot easier because of the pre-trained models that we talked about.

24
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:23,740
So think of it an ML pipeline as a way to deal with unstructured data.

25
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,994
Take unstructured data, pass them through ML APIs,

26
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:30,070
and then you are left with entities,

27
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:36,950
places, labels, people, things that you can build a simple ML model out of.

28
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,415
So you don't have to start with unstructured data,

29
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:42,970
process the unstructured data through an ML API and take

30
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,140
the results of the ML API as the input to your custom ML model.
