If there's one thing I want you to take away from this module, it is that the magic of machine learning comes with quantity, not complexity. Many small machine learning models, each of which are simple. So think of a map's example. So if you're building many machine learning models, and planning for many more that you may never build, you want to have an environment where you fail fast. The idea is that if you're failing fast, you get the ability to iterate. This ability to experiment is critical in the realm of machine learning. So you want to fail fast and iterate so that you can try a lot of new ideas, and that way, get a lot more successes. Now when I say a data, most people immediately think structured data, as in data in a database. But 90 percent of enterprise data is unstructured. Think emails, video footage, texts, reports, catalogs, fashion shoots, events, news, you name it. All unstructured data. Dealing with unstructured data has gotten a lot easier because of the pre-trained models that we talked about. So think of it an ML pipeline as a way to deal with unstructured data. Take unstructured data, pass them through ML APIs, and then you are left with entities, places, labels, people, things that you can build a simple ML model out of. So you don't have to start with unstructured data, process the unstructured data through an ML API and take the results of the ML API as the input to your custom ML model.
