00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,145
The ML Marketplace is moving towards increasing levels of Machine Learning abstraction.

2
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:13,880
Aucnet built their own custom model to classify car parts and estimate the price.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,120
But that was a custom model built from scratch.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,120
Ocado was able to build off the natural language API.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:28,885
So, they parsed results from the NL API and used it to route customer emails.

6
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:30,640
They were not starting from scratch,

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,965
they were starting from one level higher,

8
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:36,932
restarting from a natural language API and they could use the sentiment and

9
00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:41,795
entities from that API to help them their routing decisions.

10
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:46,370
Giphy, which is the third level of abstraction on this slide,

11
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,810
Giphy uses the vision API to find the text in memes,

12
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,445
and it uses optical character recognition.

13
00:00:54,445 --> 00:01:00,420
So, here Giphy is able to use a vision API as is to find text in memes.

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,580
A social media company,

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,735
as another example uses a vision API to reject inappropriate uploads.

16
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:12,450
That's another example of using the API as is to solve a business problem.

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,510
And the final, on the right hand side,

18
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,280
is a much higher level abstraction.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,110
For example, Uniqlo used design a shopping chatbot using

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,730
Dialogflow and they were able to use

21
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,295
Dialogflow to create a completely new shopping experience.

22
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,760
And this is something that you will see over and over

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,720
again where things used to be done with custom image models.

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,605
Over time, we're going to go towards increasing levels of

25
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:42,495
ML abstraction following the typical journey of most software,

26
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:45,180
where you tend to build things at a very low level

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,120
while the technology is still new and maturing.

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,535
And as the technology matures,

29
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:55,130
things start to get more and more abstract and much more high level.

30
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:01,555
In this specialization, we're going to be focusing on building custom machine models.

31
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,550
So, we're going to teach you how to do Machine Learning,

32
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,015
and the level of abstraction that we are going to work at

33
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:10,400
will be around building custom models.

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,220
But be aware that increasingly,

35
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,820
you will get to incorporate Machine Learning into

36
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,490
your applications primarily in the form of APIs.

37
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:24,910
Of course, somebody will have to build these APIs for the marketplace and perhaps,

38
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,430
you are the builder of such Machine Learning API.
