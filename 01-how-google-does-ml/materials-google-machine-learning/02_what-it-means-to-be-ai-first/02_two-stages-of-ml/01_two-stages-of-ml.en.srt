1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,670
The first stage of ML is to
train an ML model with examples.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,590
The form of machine learning that we'll
be focused on in this specialization

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,800
is called supervised learning.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,080
And in supervised learning
we start from examples.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,930
An example consists of a label and
an input.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,811
For example, suppose we want to train
a machine learning model to look at

7
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:27,943
images and
identify what's in those images.

8
00:00:27,943 --> 00:00:30,470
The true answer is called the label.

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:36,250
So cat for the first image, and dog for
the second image, those are the labels.

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,640
The image itself, the pixels of
the image are the input to the model.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,170
The model itself is
a mathematical function

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,110
of a form that can be applied
to a wide variety of problems.

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,355
There are many such
mathematical functions.

14
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:57,451
The models used in machine learning have
a bunch of adjustable parameters though,

15
00:00:57,451 --> 00:00:59,270
all of them do.

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,160
Then when we train a model,

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,830
what we're doing is that we're making
tiny adjustments to the model.

18
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,150
So that the output of the model,
the output of the mathematical function,

19
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:15,510
is as close as possible to the true
answer for any given input.

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,224
Of course,
we don't do this on one image at a time.

21
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:21,533
The idea is to adjust
the mathematical function so

22
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,368
that overall, the outputs of the model for

23
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:29,280
the set of training inputs is as close
as possible to the training labels.

24
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,470
The key thing is that machine learning,
at least,

25
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,560
machine learning of the form that
we'll consider in this course.

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,020
The most mature form of machine learning

27
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,280
relies on having a data
set of labeled examples.

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,680
And by labeled examples,
we mean the input and the true answer.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,110
And after the model is trained,

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,410
we can use it to predict the label of
images that it has never seen before.

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,880
Here, we are inputting to
the trained model this image.

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,010
And because the network has been trained,
it is correctly able to output cat.

33
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,190
Notice that the cat image on this slide
is different from the one before it.

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,390
It still works because the machine
learning model has generalized

35
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,051
from the specific examples of cat
images that we showed it to a more

36
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:25,727
general idea of what a cat is and
what it looks like.

37
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:30,719
The key to making a machine learning
model generalized is data, and lots and

38
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,280
lots of it.

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,310
Having labeled the data is a precondition
for successful machine learning.

40
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,410
It is important to realize that
machine learning has two stages,

41
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,068
training and inference.

42
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:48,345
Sometimes people refer to
prediction as inference,

43
00:02:48,345 --> 00:02:51,490
because prediction seems
to imply a future state.

44
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,291
In the case of images like this, we're
not really predicting that it's a cat,

45
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,670
just inferring that it's a cat
based on the pixel data.

46
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,231
It can be tempting as a data
scientist to focus all

47
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:09,046
your energy on the first stage,
on training.

48
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:13,602
But this is not enough, you need to
be able to operationalize the model,

49
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:17,500
put the model into production so
that you can run inferences.

50
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,469
Look at many books on machine learning,
blog posts,

51
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,985
university courses, they tend to
ignore the second stage of ML.

52
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:28,176
But in the real world,

53
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:32,990
what is the use of training a machine
learning model if you cannot use it?

54
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:38,519
In this specialization, we'll be careful
to show you machine learning end-to-end.

55
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,150
And by end-to-end, we mean putting
machine learning models into production.
