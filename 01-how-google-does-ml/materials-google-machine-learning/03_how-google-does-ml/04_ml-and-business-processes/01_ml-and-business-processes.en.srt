1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
In this lecture, we're going to talk about ML and Business Processes.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,140
So, when we think about how we're going to get from

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,245
a No ML to ML solution in our organization this path,

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:15,108
I really want us to think about the evolution of a business process.

5
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:16,700
And here when I say a business process,

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,200
I'm talking about any set of activities a company must do

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,000
directly or indirectly to serve customers.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,080
Organizations must continually improve

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,900
these processes which they do through a feedback loop, and this is really critical.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,570
Oftentimes, when we think of business processes,

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,965
we forget that almost every one of them has a feedback loop,

12
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:37,530
and understanding that loop becomes really important to understanding

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,560
the role ML plays inside a large organization.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,885
So, let me give you a concrete example.

15
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:46,965
Let's say we have a call center and the call center takes customer questions,

16
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:51,480
and they produces answered questions so you call your favorite local telecom,

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,336
and you say, "There's a problem with my Wi-Fi router."

18
00:00:54,336 --> 00:00:56,315
And the call center answers it for you.

19
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:59,605
But the interaction doesn't end there.

20
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:02,490
We all know that after that call center hangs up they say,

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,194
would you like to answer the survey or they email you.

22
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:07,410
And what they do if you actually answer the surveys,

23
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,805
is they take all those answers,

24
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:11,064
and they extract new insights from them.

25
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:12,758
They get new canned answers,

26
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:16,560
new product promotions, or decision trees on how to handle future calls.

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,985
And then those new insights,

28
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:21,685
they get fed into HR or training reference manuals,

29
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,873
and the employees are retrained,

30
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:28,135
and those retrained employees may now go answer new customer questions.

31
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:31,665
And this is this kind of feedback loop that allows us to convert

32
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:36,390
operational expertise into better future outcomes.

33
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,970
Now here, I'm showing you a more general view of this.

34
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,762
So here, we have some input and some output to a process,

35
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:45,165
this looks similar to our example of what

36
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:48,630
ML is compared to software, that's not an accident.

37
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,535
And now, what we do is we take this output,

38
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:53,220
and we regenerate new insights from it,

39
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,130
and these insights are going to give us some new operational parameters

40
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,005
such as a new canned answers or a new product promotion.

41
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:04,335
And then we're going to tune the original process with updated instructions.

42
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:07,650
And here again, we have this flow but in a much more general way,

43
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,585
they could be applied to almost any business process in any organization.

44
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:15,460
And so, when we think about the path to ML,

45
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,850
I want you to think about how we're going to automate each one of these boxes,

46
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,570
each one of these cornerstones and the business process tuning.

47
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,345
So, in the first step for anything,

48
00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:32,478
I'm going to explain more of these steps later slide.

49
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:36,610
But, the first step of any new business processes just individual contributor,

50
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,958
one person doing it,

51
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,460
and then you get multiple people doing it,

52
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,230
and then you digitize that process,

53
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,970
and these steps one, two,

54
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,315
and three, they all affect the core process itself.

55
00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:49,630
But, as you know in the last decade or so, Big Data,

56
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,590
and Analytics, and Machine Learning have become very popular and very impactful.

57
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,780
And what happens there is we're trying to automate

58
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,790
the inside generation phases and the tuning phases,

59
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,635
and thus, we have automated the entire feedback loop.

60
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:06,710
So, I want to go ahead and define what I mean by these a little bit more detail.

61
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,100
So business processes that eventually end in ML,

62
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,375
typically go through five phases.

63
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,145
Now, they don't have to spend the same amount of time and each of these phases,

64
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:16,510
but skipping these phases as we'll see later,

65
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,565
usually isn't a good idea.

66
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,870
So, the first one,

67
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,390
what do I mean when I say, "individual contributor"?

68
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,862
So, a task or business process that's in

69
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:28,660
the individual contributor phase is performed by a single person,

70
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,335
and a great example is like the receptionist inside the office building.

71
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:34,625
This person, call, answer the phone,

72
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,550
maybe points people towards the bathroom,

73
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,623
just one of them,

74
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:40,950
and the task is not paralyzed or scaled at all,

75
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,685
usually it's very informal.

76
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:44,734
And then what happens is as the task or

77
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:47,586
the business process becomes more important to the company.

78
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:49,000
Usually, we start to delegate,

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,405
we get multiple people who are all performing the same task in parallel.

80
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:54,845
A good example would be like a store checker.

81
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:57,400
And what happens when we start to delegate is we have to start to

82
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,295
formalize the role and put in rules,

83
00:04:00,295 --> 00:04:05,070
so that each store checker starts to behave a little bit more like the others.

84
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,850
So, there's some repeatability in the task.

85
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,325
Then we get to digitization.

86
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:11,270
A little bit of a marketing buzzword.

87
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,490
But, what I mean is that we take

88
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:17,005
the recore repeatable part of a task or a business process,

89
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,660
and we automate it with computers.

90
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,529
Great example is an ATM.

91
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,885
ATM's can't do everything.

92
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:25,975
Right? You can't open a mortgage through an ATM,

93
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,875
but you can withdraw a cash.

94
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:31,870
And because that cash withdrawal part of that business process,

95
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,340
where the interaction with the user is so repeatable and so well automated,

96
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,008
customers get a very high quality of service using ATM's,

97
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:44,799
and how many of us actually would walk into a bank to extract $40?

98
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:49,005
Almost no one. But after we digitize, what happens next?

99
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:51,280
Now, we move into big data and analytics,

100
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,680
and the idea is here we're going to use a lot of

101
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,205
data to build operational and user insights.

102
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:58,725
So maybe, when I say operational,

103
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:01,025
a good example will be like, Toyota manufacturing.

104
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:06,380
So, Toyota is famous for their lean manufacturing philosophy,

105
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,410
where they kind of measure everything about their construction or their facilities,

106
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,780
and then they use that to tune each little knob in

107
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,255
the process to get better and better outcomes,

108
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:17,847
and faster and faster cars,

109
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:20,555
faster and faster time to delivery.

110
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:22,360
And you could do this for

111
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,315
your internal operations or you could do this to learn about your external users,

112
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:29,620
and this would be like marketing research on steroids.

113
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,650
And then, of course, we get to machine learning,

114
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,825
which is kind of we're going to represent the last phase in the path the ML.

115
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:37,300
And here, we're going to do is going to use

116
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,440
all this data that we had from the previous step.

117
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,870
We're going to automatically start to improve these computer processes.

118
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,870
And a big example here is YouTube Recommendations.

119
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,130
As you click through YouTube,

120
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,300
and you watch different videos,

121
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,313
and you like them,

122
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:52,770
or you don't like them, or you watch to the end or not,

123
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,850
the algorithm is learning in the background.

124
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,110
What are good videos,

125
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,550
what kind of videos you like,

126
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,825
how you are different or similar to other users.

127
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:02,705
What I want to do is we think about this path MLs.

128
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:04,255
I want you to take a moment, I want you to sketch

129
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:08,440
this diagram for a specific example from your organization.

130
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,540
It doesn't have to be an ML example.

131
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,820
Maybe you have digitized part of this business process, but not all of it.

132
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,590
What phases of the pathed ML is your example in?

133
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,000
Do you have another example too that's in a different phase?
