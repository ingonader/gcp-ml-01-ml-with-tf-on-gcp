00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,795
In this lecture, we're going to deep dive into The Path to ML.

2
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:08,235
Let's examine each step a little bit more closely.

3
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:11,670
Let's clarify the road map that a process or product goes

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,875
through as it gets further automated and approaches and becomes ML.

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,645
Let's keep in mind as we go through this,

6
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:21,666
some examples from your company or your organization.

7
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,000
Have they gone through any of these steps?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,180
How did it work out?

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,130
Where did the company spend most of its time or where did it skip entirely?

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,350
And do these phases seem hopeful like a constructive framework to think about?

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,710
Or do they seem more like obstacles?

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,175
So let's go ahead and live. For the first one,

13
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:42,010
let's start with the individual contributor phase and let's examine it.

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,501
So this is a great opportunity to prototype.

15
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:48,165
Almost every product or process starts here.

16
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:50,025
It's cheap, it's flexible,

17
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:52,069
great for trying out many ideas,

18
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:54,545
failing quickly and learning from that.

19
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:56,805
There are some dangers of skipping this step.

20
00:00:56,805 --> 00:01:01,095
There's the inability to get organizational investment to scale up to a bigger effort.

21
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:04,095
How are you going to convince your boss that you need

22
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:07,130
a hundred people or you need to build this huge software system,

23
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,745
if no one's even tried it, kind of manually?

24
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:12,818
No one's then even that most basic prototyping.

25
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:14,400
Perhaps even more worrisome,

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,520
is that your organization does jump right on and then

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,826
the product heads could make big incorrect assumptions,

28
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:23,785
that once you've made investments are hard to change later.

29
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:25,770
I've seen both of these happen.

30
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,335
There are also dangers of lingering here too long.

31
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:31,603
Imagine you've got one person who's very skilled at his or her job,

32
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:34,050
and then leaves the company, maybe they retire.

33
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,075
And all that organizational know how,

34
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:37,920
walks right out the door with them.

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,295
That can be a real problem.

36
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:40,920
You have suddenly two weeks,

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,105
you have no one's able to perform that process in the company.

38
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,946
And then the one people more often think about at the individual contributor phase,

39
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:52,065
is they just can't scale up the process to meet demand in time.

40
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:54,087
You've got one person doing something,

41
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:55,620
suddenly you need aid,

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,370
and no one's even formalized the process.

43
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,055
And this poor man or woman just can't answer the phone fast enough.

44
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,320
So what happens? Well, ideally,

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,565
we move on to the delegation phase.

46
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:08,190
And here, we're going to increase the number of

47
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,665
employees working on some business process

48
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:15,865
to hundreds or if you're Walmart or the US Military, even to millions.

49
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:20,160
What's nice about this, is it allows us to gently ramp up the investment while we

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,635
maintain most of the flexibility

51
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:25,475
of the previous stage when we only had one person doing it.

52
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:27,715
The dangers of skipping this step.

53
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,220
So if you skip this step,

54
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,350
you're never forced to formalize the business process and to define success.

55
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,005
Imagine, when we delegate.

56
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,630
Imagine we're actually going to outsource, as an example.

57
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,350
If you can't explain exactly what you need to happen in

58
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,808
this business processes to someone 12 time zones away,

59
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:46,500
you probably also can't explain it to a computer.

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,360
Computers have even less context about what you're

61
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,745
trying to accomplish than someone in India may.

62
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:55,965
So this is a great halfway step to formalizing business processes.

63
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:59,275
And also, getting organizational buy in for what is success,

64
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:01,580
because this is not a cheap phase.

65
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,990
There's also this great opportunity at

66
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,665
this stage that human responses have an inherent diversity.

67
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:11,917
And this becomes a test bed for great product learning.

68
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:15,375
As each human, let's say as an example in a call center,

69
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,723
each human answers the phone a little bit differently.

70
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:20,765
And then, they have different customer outcomes.

71
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:24,090
Then, in the organization,

72
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,590
when you review that data,

73
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,355
you can learn what's working and what's not.

74
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:33,610
Then finally, great ML systems will need humans in the loop.

75
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,685
And this is your opportunity to identify who you need.

76
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:41,490
And inside Google, we have many ML systems.

77
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,865
Many ML systems that generate a lot of value for the organization,

78
00:03:44,865 --> 00:03:47,535
for our customers, for our end users.

79
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:53,400
And almost every single one has a team of people reviewing the algorithms,

80
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,625
reviewing their responses, reviewing where they get confused, doing random sub-samples.

81
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,100
Because if your ML system is very,

82
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,000
very important, then it needs to be reviewed and you're going to have people doing this.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,945
And you should think about ML as a way to

84
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:14,430
expand the impact or to scale the impact of your people,

85
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,395
not as a way of completely removing them.

86
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:20,305
Because that's a very high bar for an ML system to meet.

87
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:23,005
What are the dangers of lingering too long here?

88
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,450
I mean, the most obvious is,

89
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,300
you're paying very high marginal cost to serve each user.

90
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,600
When people answer phones, it's expensive.

91
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,505
If you have someone sitting in a bank to

92
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:38,107
wait someone to walk into the bank to open a mortgage,

93
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:40,655
it's expensive. But we all know this.

94
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,363
Perhaps a little bit more subtly,

95
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:45,030
the more people you have in your organization,

96
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,580
the more voices you have to say, automation is impossible.

97
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,820
And this creates a kind of organizational lock-in,

98
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,575
when you have so many stakeholders.

99
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:55,250
Because the people have their own managers, their own H.R.

100
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,695
reps, and so we want to win a delegate,

101
00:04:57,695 --> 00:04:59,610
but we want to always be moving forward.

102
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,535
We want to always be going down this path whenever appropriate.

103
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:06,645
And that leads us into the digitization phase,

104
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:09,480
which is just a fancy term for getting computer systems to

105
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,320
perform the mundane or repetitive parts of the process.

106
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,320
And in general, the digitization is a part of automation.

107
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,740
And in general, we think of automation economically as a way to

108
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,705
trade upfront investment for a lower marginal cost or run rate.

109
00:05:24,705 --> 00:05:28,420
Now, automation gets us a lot of thing and maybe you first think about, Oh.

110
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,480
Wait, we don't want to get rid of people.

111
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,370
You're right. We want to scale their impact.

112
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,375
We want to give our users a higher quality of service.

113
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,670
And automation is a great way to do that.

114
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,240
But because it involves so much upfront investment,

115
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,300
it comes with its own risk.

116
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,936
So the dangers of skipping this step.

117
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:46,795
Even with a great machine learning algorithm,

118
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:52,385
you will need all the infrastructure of this step to be able to serve your ML at scale.

119
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,093
Remember, machine learning perform some core,

120
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:58,470
almost numerical task but it doesn't serve

121
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,835
that task in a website or it doesn't have unit tests of its own.

122
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:05,820
And all of this stuff that comes with software,

123
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,615
you are also going to need it for ML.

124
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,910
And most just going to replace

125
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,605
a little piece of your otherwise very large software stack.

126
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:15,115
Also, if you skip this step,

127
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:17,775
and I see many people try, you start to untangle an.

128
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:20,700
IT project, which we may call software,

129
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,770
with an ML project.

130
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,960
And then suddenly, either one of them fails,

131
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,738
the whole project fails.

132
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:30,255
And organizationally, it's very tricky to say what really happened.

133
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:35,449
And you may find that management is dis-incentivized in the future from investing,

134
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:38,010
because it's so hard to untangle what's going on.

135
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,220
So I always encourage people to try to do as much IT project,

136
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,413
show its own success,

137
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:44,318
and its own milestones,

138
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:47,170
and then see ML as icing on the cake.

139
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,945
The dangers of staying here too long.

140
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:51,690
So, the other members of your industry are

141
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,270
collecting data and they're tuning their offers,

142
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,540
they're tuning their operation from these new insights.

143
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,140
And this is giving them an edge.

144
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,506
And this is giving them,

145
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:06,135
this is constructing a very positive feedback loop for them.

146
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:11,175
After digitization, we start to think about big data and analytics.

147
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:13,620
And what we're going to do here is measure everything

148
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,680
about your internal operations and external users.

149
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,550
We're going to make it easy to review, summarize, deep dive,

150
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,780
and this is a great moment to pause and reiterate your definitions of success,

151
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,995
and then detune software algorithms that we described in the previous step.

152
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:33,495
So why is this such a great opportunity to redefine success?

153
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,963
So kind of the first stage,

154
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:37,960
the initial individual contributor, all the way up to here,

155
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,160
we've been using kind of like market research or kind of standard ways to

156
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,890
hypothesize about what our users wants or wherever possible to apply data.

157
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,665
But now that we're in the Big Data phase,

158
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:52,620
we've automated the core process with digitization,

159
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,380
which means that we may now extract an incredible amount

160
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,260
of data because everything is digital for us.

161
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,900
And with this new data,

162
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,105
we can reassess our original definition and say,

163
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:06,550
"Hey, we thought users wanted A, is that really true?

164
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,494
Are we actually serving A correctly?"

165
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:11,160
And this gives us many new insights.

166
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,005
The dangers of skipping the step.

167
00:08:13,005 --> 00:08:15,990
So if you try to go from software right into ML without ever

168
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,170
having this kind of manual insight generation phase,

169
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,725
you're going to run into some obstacles.

170
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:25,260
First, you won't be able train your ML algorithm,

171
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,530
because your data is not clean and organized.

172
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,216
If you cannot make a histogram of your data,

173
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:34,335
your algorithm cannot effectively make that histogram either.

174
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:36,533
And more or less, that's what your algorithm is doing,

175
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,740
is it's making many, many plots and performing regression on them.

176
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,214
So if you can't make that chart,

177
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:44,125
neither can your algorithm.

178
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,570
Also, if you skipped this step,

179
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,295
then you won't build a measure of success.

180
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:50,120
So it's hard to tell if your ML algorithm's actually improving things.

181
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,800
So we're going to start by manually doing all these things and then when we're ready,

182
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,075
ML will automatically be cleaning,

183
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:02,775
and all be automatically acting on this clean and organized data.

184
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,549
What happens if we stay here too long?

185
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,590
Actually, the dangers of that are not as major as some of the other steps.

186
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,055
As an example, Google search stayed here four years.

187
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:16,583
Everyone thinks that Google search is like this really maniacally impressive ML,

188
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,430
natural language processing algorithm.

189
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,955
And maybe it is now.

190
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:21,560
But it wasn't for many, many years.

191
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,015
It was actually a hand-tuned algorithm.

192
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:25,435
And this is actually really interesting.

193
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:28,170
You should take this message to heart that like you can get very,

194
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,725
very far without handing over everything to ML.

195
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:35,175
But of course, without ML,

196
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,365
you are going to limit the complexity of problems you can solve.

197
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:41,547
And the speed at which you can solve them.

198
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,790
So finally, let's talk about the last stage,

199
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,172
the machine learning phase.

200
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:46,580
Here, what we're going to do, is we're going to complete

201
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,300
that feedback loop we talked about before.

202
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,435
We're going to automate each of those blocks

203
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:54,225
between measuring success and tuning the software algorithm.

204
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:57,500
Eventually, this will outpaced humans ability to handle the number of inputs and

205
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,123
the corner cases involved in your real world data,

206
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:03,050
in your real world use case.

207
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,490
Generally, roughly at Google,

208
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,805
we expect about a 10 percent key performance indicator increase

209
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:10,925
in Google products on top of all the human-hand tuning,

210
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:15,925
just from ML's ability to handle each of those little details so incredibly well.

211
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,540
And of course, the reason we're all here,

212
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,330
what makes machine learning so fascinating is we're going to escape

213
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,560
the limitations of human cognition in solving our business problem.

214
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,970
We're going to get faster answers,

215
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,950
more nuanced treatment of details,

216
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,645
and perhaps what is most mind blowing to me,

217
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:34,535
is there will be one brain learning from billions of interactions every day.

218
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:36,845
Google search as an example from the last slide,

219
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,790
is able to watch how one user is searching for new terms and apply that to

220
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,590
searches happening for another user as it

221
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,235
learns about the content to the world around it.

222
00:10:45,235 --> 00:10:47,139
And this is truly fascinating.

223
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:48,945
In your organization, this will happen to.

224
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:54,000
As you have one ML algorithm that is learning from many disparate interactions around it.
