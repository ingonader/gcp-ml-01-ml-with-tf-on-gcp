Hi, I'm Josh Cogan.

2
00:00:01,774 --> 00:00:03,820
I'm a software engineer at Google.

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,160
Today, I'm excited to talk to
you about how Google does ML.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,508
This talk is about the organizational
know-how we've acquired over the years,

5
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:15,478
as we have built probably more
value-generating ML systems than any other

6
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:16,054
company.

7
00:00:16,054 --> 00:00:20,223
This is a topic that I know first-hand,
from my work on Google's own systems, and

8
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:23,799
as an adviser to many companies as
they've made the transition to using

9
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:27,420
machine learning to address
their core business problems.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,103
This probably isn't
the talk you're expecting.

11
00:00:29,103 --> 00:00:32,930
There's no math, there's no TensorFlow,
there's not even any cloud.

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,430
For the next little bit, we're
going to put on our business hats and

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,740
look at ML the way the owner of
a business or someone responsible for

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,090
setting its direction would.
