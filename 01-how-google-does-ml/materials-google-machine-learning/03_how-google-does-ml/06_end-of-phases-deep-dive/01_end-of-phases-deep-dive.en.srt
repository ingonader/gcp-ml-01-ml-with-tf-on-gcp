1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,132
In this action, we're going to summarize the five phases in the Path ML.

2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:06,320
In the last section,

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,685
we talked about each of these phases in more detail.

4
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:10,885
But now, what I want to do is zoom out,

5
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:16,360
kind of rotate the issue on side and give you a different view of all that same content.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,950
So, we talked about these five phases and it was contributor,

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,235
delegation, digitization, big data, and machine learning.

8
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:29,660
One of the axes of change between each of these is who or what is executing the process.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,040
So, as we look at this diagram,

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,125
which was made for you visual learners out there,

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,735
we see that in the individual contributor phase,

12
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,725
we have one person, when we get to delegation,

13
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:39,380
we have many people.

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,990
But the other three phases,

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,355
it's always the same entity executing the process.

16
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:47,580
It's always a computer or some server rack.

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,360
But there's another axis of differentiation,

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,990
and that's how do we choose the operational parameters?

19
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,105
So, from the individual contributor,

20
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:58,430
all the way out to digitization,

21
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,570
we're doing some kind of market research or some kind of less than pure, we call,

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,000
more hypothetical exercise about, well,

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,566
this is what I think users want,

24
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,720
this is what I think we should try to accomplish.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,420
And then we get to big data.

26
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,600
We actually, for the first time,

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,360
have the opportunity to produce an incredible amount of

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,905
very deep rich market insight or user insight or operational insight.

29
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:22,985
And this gives us a new method to choose these operational parameters.

30
00:01:22,985 --> 00:01:24,320
And then in machine learning,

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,625
you could imagine we're just going to start to regress or to make some,

32
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:33,550
we're going to fit the data with a line or obviously maybe more complicated curve,

33
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,790
where we start to actually perform

34
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,400
these fitting parameters and extract to cases we may not have seen yet.

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,420
And then this final axis of differentiation is

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,485
given that we have these better operational parameters,

37
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:50,125
how are they fed back into the execution of the core process?

38
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,905
So, as long as we of humans accomplishing the task in the first row,

39
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,410
then the way we feed back the execution,

40
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,785
is we have some kind of like H.R training

41
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:04,800
or reference manual or something that the humans refer back to as needed.

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,185
Of course, if you have a truly individual contributor,

43
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:10,615
the worst case scenario is nothing's written down.

44
00:02:10,615 --> 00:02:14,120
So, we always hope that there is some kind of employee handbook.

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,800
But then, as we move from digitization and big data, now,

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,810
when we have these new operational parameters,

47
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,210
we know what we should be offering to our users.

48
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,425
We're going to rely on our software engineer with

49
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:27,160
the headphones to go ahead and put that back into

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,230
our code so that it may be acted on and presented to our users.

51
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,705
And then, when we get to machine learning,

52
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:38,050
a machine learning is actually going to be deriving

53
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,210
these new operational parameters and feeding them back in automatically.

54
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,890
So, I want to zoom even further back into

55
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,670
some final reminders about this lecture in general.

56
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:54,079
It's tempting to jump from nothing to a fully machine learned solution,

57
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,750
but it's a risky move.

58
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,940
Success in Google and likely in your organization too,

59
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,620
typically follows a more structured approach that

60
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,010
steadily increases that upfront investment

61
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,920
as the business uncertainties decrease with

62
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,130
more experience and research into your users and your product niche.

63
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,555
And we've talked a lot about this business process score feedback loop here.

64
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:21,265
And the main goal of the Path ML is of course,

65
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:23,705
to automate all the blue boxes,

66
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:27,400
and that's what we're trying to do and that's the Path ML.

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,655
The good news is Google can help,

68
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:35,950
Google has a variety of services that can help you in across this path,

69
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,440
starting an innovation contributor, but of course,

70
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,895
because we're cloud offering,

71
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:43,150
we get very strong once you get to the digitization and beyond.

72
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,590
And I've given you a link here where you can find

73
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,995
more training opportunities from Google Cloud.

74
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,860
So, what are the next steps here?

75
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,170
So, when this module got an overview of the path to ML-ify your business.

76
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,780
You're taking a course here of course, this is your opportunity to think big.

77
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,290
How many different ways can you think of changing your industry?

78
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,035
Changing your business? Changing your group?

79
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:07,770
Doesn't matter how small you start,

80
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,860
but what are we going to do that's know.

81
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,480
Finally, welcome to machine learning specialization,

82
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,068
into a career in machine learning,

83
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:19,000
you're going to love the ride. Thank you so much.
