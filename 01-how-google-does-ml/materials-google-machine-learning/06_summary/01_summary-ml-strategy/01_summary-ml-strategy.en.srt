1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
To summarize this course then,

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,585
we talked about the aim of the specialization,

3
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:07,415
which is to teach you how to build

4
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:09,635
production machine learning models

5
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:13,055
whether you're a Python programmer or a data scientist.

6
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,640
This specialization consists of a series of courses that

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,375
provide a practical real-world introduction to machine learning.

8
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:26,470
And then, we looked at how Google views machine learning as

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,650
a way to replace heuristic rules that tend to build up over time.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,260
For example, Google search used heuristic rules to

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,420
decide whether we needed to return

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,705
a page for the San Francisco Giants or New York Giants.

13
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:43,705
This is now done using machine learning.

14
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:47,230
We then talked about machine learning as a way to increasingly

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,385
personalize your businesses offerings for your customers,

16
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,920
using Google Maps as an example.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,310
For example, while routing directions between

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,585
point A and point B can be done with a deterministic algorithm,

19
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:08,300
inferring which floor of a subway station you're in need some amount of machine learning.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,480
But building personalized recommendations,

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,198
that's impossible to do at scale without ML.

22
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:20,265
We then delved into the secret sauce behind machine learning.

23
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:24,220
And it turns out to be something quite unglamorous.

24
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,795
It's all about building organizational know-how.

25
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:34,540
It's important to recognize the five phases that business processes tend to

26
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,750
go through and not skip any of the stages in order to be successful at machine learning.

27
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:47,450
It's also important to recognize how to transition between these phases thoughtfully.

28
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,640
And finally, we talked about why fair is not the default in

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,640
machine learning and how to recognize biases

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,480
that can be amplified because of the data you use.

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,425
Unconscious bias affects the way we do machine learning

32
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:06,802
because it can get reinforced in the training data that we collect,

33
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:09,835
it affects the way we collect and classify data,

34
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:11,800
how we design and write code.

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,920
To give you a taste of machine learning,

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,450
we introduced Qwiklabs as a way to start trying out Google Cloud platform.

37
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,540
This is a way for you to do the labs in this specialization

38
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,410
without having to pay extra for the computing resources.

39
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,635
Qwiklabs also has a number of other labs and quests.

40
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:31,990
I strongly encourage you to practice and gain

41
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,610
experience in machine learning and Cloud technologies using Qwiklabs.

42
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,075
We also told you how to find the source code.

43
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,515
It's on GitHub, it's open source,

44
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:46,920
and you should totally use our examples as a starting point for your projects.

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,520
We also looked at Cloud Datalab.

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,110
Python notebooks are the tool of choice for data scientists and is

47
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,980
a way that you will do the majority of hands-on activities in this specialization.

48
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,665
Now, the notebooks in this specialization are already worked out.

49
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:10,160
So I encourage you to pause and think as you go through the notebooks step by step.

50
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,035
And if you are up to the challenge,

51
00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:13,910
you could also remove some of

52
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,625
the key cells and see if you can write the necessary code yourself.

53
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:23,145
We talked about how Cloud storage and compute engine provide the CPU

54
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:27,670
and storage necessary for ephemeral distributed notebooks.

55
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,465
And then, we use the notebook to launch

56
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:34,320
big query queries on thousands of machines at scale.

57
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,420
This, for example, is a query that's carried

58
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,060
out on a dataset of millions of healthcare claims.

59
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,320
We also invoked pre-trained machine learning models that are available as API.

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,573
As machine learning matures,

61
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:53,160
many of the reusable tasks will be available in pre-trained form,

62
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,395
whether it's vision or speech.

63
00:03:55,395 --> 00:04:00,910
A key point that these machine learning APIs teach us is that we want

64
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:06,095
to take our machine learning models and make them just as easy to use.

65
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:10,750
In this case, all of the machine learning API where rest APIs,

66
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,675
they are microservices and they provided a very high level of abstraction.

67
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:21,280
And with that, we come to the end of the first course of the specialization.

68
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,000
Join us for the next course which will be on creating machine learning datasets.
