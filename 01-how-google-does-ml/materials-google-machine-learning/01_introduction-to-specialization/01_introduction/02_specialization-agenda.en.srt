1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,865
We start the specialization with this course.

2
00:00:03,865 --> 00:00:05,800
How Google does ML,

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,805
where I introduce Machine Learning and

4
00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:12,065
what Google means when we say we are AI first.

5
00:00:12,065 --> 00:00:17,420
My colleague Josh then comes in to talk about the strategy of Machine Learning.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,940
We end with a discussion of two link of how to do Machine Learning at

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,590
scale using Python notebooks and server less data processing components.

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,620
Now, if you are an engineer or a scientist,

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,950
you're probably thinking that this is all too high level and you're ready to jump to

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,170
the next course which starts to delve into technical details of TensorFlow.

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,405
But before you make that decision let me tell you something.

12
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:46,810
When we taught this set of courses to our customers,

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,570
one remarked that often came back was that the model by

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,215
Josh was the one they revisited the most often.

15
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:59,360
After they went back to work, six months later,

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,285
the model that they went to look at the most was on the strategy of Machine Learning.

17
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:11,040
So you want to get the big picture before you delve into the technical details because

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,350
the big picture is very important for you to

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,860
be able to get by in from the rest of the organization.

20
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,735
To carry out, we then move on to doing Machine Learning with TensorFlow.

21
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:25,090
That involves two aspects.

22
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,855
One, creating a good Machine Learning dataset and two,

23
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:33,420
building your first Machine Learning model with TensorFlow.

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,480
Creating a Machine Learning dataset is another of

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,935
those practical models that you don't want to ignore.

26
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:43,475
When you create a Machine Learning model and it works well

27
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:47,540
in your experiments but then fails miserably in production,

28
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,875
the reason that often come back to how you created the Machine Learning dataset.

29
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:57,160
So give yourself time to absorb the lessons and then we

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,835
have two courses that are about improving Machine Learning accuracy.

31
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:04,575
As you build your first Machine Learning model,

32
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:08,425
you will learn that there are lots of things you can do to improve that model.

33
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:13,825
So think of this section as filling your tool chest with a set of ideas.

34
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:16,750
You'll use different ideas in different situations.

35
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,880
So you'll find that knowing them will be helpful in

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,315
your career as you solve different Machine Learning problems.

37
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:28,250
And as before, it's not enough to just name, check these concepts.

38
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,350
You need to give yourself time to understand them.

39
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,780
And know how to implement them in code.

40
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,535
We then move on to a set of courses

41
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:41,505
that are about operationalizing the Machine Learning model.

42
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:43,390
As I mentioned earlier,

43
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,840
operationalizing a Machine Learning model,

44
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,270
and by that I mean,

45
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,430
training it at scale in a distributed way serving out the predictions,

46
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,165
building a Machine Learning model end to end.

47
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:59,470
Operationalizing a Machine Learning model can be super hard.

48
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,535
It is a stage where most enterprise Machine Learning projects fail.

49
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:07,675
I cannot tell you how many companies I've talked to,

50
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:12,865
who have said their innovation teams had devised these cool ML projects,

51
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:17,565
but they were struggling getting the ML models into production.

52
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,590
In this set of courses,

53
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,080
we will talk about how to train,

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,360
deploy, and predict with ML models in a way that their production ready.

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,360
And finally, we delve back into Machine Learning theory.

56
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,830
But theory in big air quotes.

57
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,875
Machine Learning theory is mostly heuristics.

58
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,240
Machine learning is an intensely heuristic discipline

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,520
and you're only as good as your bag of tools and tricks.

60
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,785
So we'll introduce a number of tools and tricks that

61
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:52,315
work when the inputs to your Machine Learning models are images.

62
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:57,725
Tools and tricks that help in your processing are outputting sequences

63
00:03:57,725 --> 00:04:03,240
and sequences in Machine Learning can be either time series data or text data.

64
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,565
And finally, we will look at several ways to build powerful recommendation systems.

65
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:13,805
Recommendation systems or how you build personalized algorithms.

66
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:19,295
And so it's something that most ML engineers build at some point in their careers.

67
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:23,795
In fact, it might be the only ML system that many people will build.

68
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:27,715
But in order to build powerful recommendation engines,

69
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:30,750
it turns out that you need to understand tools and

70
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,580
tricks that are borrowed from images and from sequences.

71
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,880
So that's why we're looking at them in this order and that's why we look

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,175
at recommendation engines pretty much at the end of the specialization.

73
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:46,885
Now, you may have encountered some of this material before,

74
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:49,660
especially in the first four courses.

75
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,160
For example, in the courses on creating

76
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,640
Machine Learning datasets and on TensorFlow basics,

77
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,730
some of the slides will be a repeat of server less Machine Learning with TensorFlow,

78
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,310
that's available on Coursera.

79
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,095
Similarly, if you encountered Google's Machine Learning crash course,

80
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:09,550
this is an internal Google course but

81
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,565
it has also been taught on some university campuses,

82
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:15,060
you might find some of the material and feature

83
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,330
representation and art and science of ML to be familiar.

84
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,280
In spite of this though,

85
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,920
the details are quite different.

86
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,675
So don't skip it completely.

87
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:29,680
Treat these courses as a useful refresher and make

88
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,600
sure that you still remember the ideas presented in those sections.
