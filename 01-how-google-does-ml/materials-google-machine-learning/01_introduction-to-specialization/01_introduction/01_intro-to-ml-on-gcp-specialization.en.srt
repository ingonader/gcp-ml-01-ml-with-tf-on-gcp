00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,670
Hello. I'm Diane Greene,

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,240
and I lead Google Cloud.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,910
I'd like to welcome you to our deep dive course on

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,500
Practical Machine Learning using Google Cloud platform.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,230
We've had thousands of Google engineers go through different variations of

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,730
this course and have also shared it with several of our customers.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,590
Through this course, we've enabled Python programmers to do machine learning,

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,960
and data scientists to build production-ready machine learning models.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,270
This was only possible because we're using

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,280
Google's incredible infrastructure and ML platform.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,390
One of our large global customers told us that switching to GCP,

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,400
Google Cloud Platform, had helped them reduce organizational silos.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,110
This was because of the combination of

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,900
global serverless infrastructure like BigQuery and open source software like TensorFlow,

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:58,050
which democratized the access to data and machine learning across their organization.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,315
In this Coursera specialization,

17
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:03,495
you'll learn the key technical skills to replicate

18
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:07,260
this and drive transformation across your company.

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,970
I'm very excited to invite you to take this course and start training,

20
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,980
deploying, and serving Machine Learning models on Google Cloud. Thank you.

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,825
Thanks, Diane.

22
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:20,485
I'm Valliappa Lakshmanan.

23
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:22,095
Everyone calls me Lak.

24
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:23,550
I'm a Technical Lead for

25
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,090
Big Data and Machine Learning professional services at Google Cloud.

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,835
I lead the team that wrote this machine learning course

27
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:32,845
for you and I'll be teaching parts of the course as well.

28
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:36,120
You'll see many of my co-authors throughout the series.

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,110
As Diane said, the aim of this specialization is to give

30
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,775
you a practical real-world introduction to machine learning.

31
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:46,590
The goal is to enable you,

32
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,670
whether you're a Python programmer data engineer or a data scientist,

33
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,620
to do machine learning and to build

34
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,160
production machine learning models. So what will you learn?
