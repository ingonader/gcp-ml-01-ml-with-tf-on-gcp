1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,665
This course on how to do machine learning is

2
00:00:02,665 --> 00:00:05,910
taught by Googlers who work in machine learning.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,775
So why would you look to Google and Googlers to learn about ML?

4
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:15,320
Well, at Google we apply machine learning and pretty much all of our products.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,575
We're teaching this course so that we can share some of what we've learned.

6
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:22,260
And we're super excited to see what you build based on

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,250
what you learn in this set of courses.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,430
Of course, we hope you build on Google Cloud.

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,125
Machine learning has completely transformed the way we,

10
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,540
Google that is, do business,

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,673
including how we approach new and existing products,

12
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:39,330
how we design our products,

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,085
and how we approach new challenges.

14
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:46,550
Many of you probably interact with Google services, photos,

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:52,250
Youtube, Gmail, Inbox, you interact with these Google services every day.

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,500
All those services benefit from,

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,775
and in some cases,

18
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:58,685
they depend upon machine learning.

19
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:02,270
We keep track of how much we use machine learning,

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,905
deep learning in particular.

21
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:06,285
And over the last few years,

22
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:11,650
we have produced over 4,000 TensorFlow machine learning model.

23
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,050
You heard that right, 4,000.

24
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,715
There are over 4,000 TensorFlow machine learning models in production at Google.

25
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:23,880
In 2012, that number was near zero.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,330
And by the end of 2016,

27
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,265
we are crossing 4,000.

28
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:30,410
So in this specialization,

29
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,690
you will learn to use the technology we use.

30
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:39,100
And this course covers how our engineers infuse machine learning into our products.
