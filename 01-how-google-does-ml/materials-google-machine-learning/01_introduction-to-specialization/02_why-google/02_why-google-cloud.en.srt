1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
One of the key lessons that we have learned along

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,225
the way is that it's important to think about machine learning serving,

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:12,810
about ML serving, not just about ML training.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,900
When you say machine learning to most people,

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,080
they think about the complex pipeline on the left of this diagram.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,080
It's certainly where you,

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,520
as a data engineer or a data scientist,

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,290
will spend a lot of your time.

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,300
However, the key reason you're doing

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,810
machine learning is on the right-hand side of this diagram.

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,365
You want to serve out those predictions to decision makers

12
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:39,450
using notebooks, dashboards, applications, reports.

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,220
Operationalizing a machine learning model, by which we mean,

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,680
picking a model that's trained and

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,095
getting to the point where he can serve out these predictions.

16
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:52,470
Operationalizing a machine learning model is hard,

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,645
and many projects fail to make it to this prediction stage.

18
00:00:56,645 --> 00:00:58,760
One of the lessons that we at Google

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,510
learned was that in order to reduce our chance of failure,

20
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:09,290
we needed to make sure that we could process batch data and streaming data the same way.

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,735
Cloud Data Flow in this diagram,

22
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:13,590
it's open source is Apache Beam.

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,220
Cloud Data Flow helps us treat batch and stream the same way.

24
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,655
So Cloud Data Flow is just one example of how, on Google Cloud,

25
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:25,415
you get to take advantage of our experience,

26
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:29,800
Google's experience, in building machine learning infrastructure.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,345
If you haven't taken our data engineering specialization on Coursera,

28
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:35,375
I strongly encourage you to take it.

29
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,710
But in this track,

30
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,470
we'll cover the key pieces as we go along.

31
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,905
Fortunately, for those of you data scientists out there,

32
00:01:42,905 --> 00:01:45,405
data engineering is not that hard to learn.

33
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:52,035
On GCP, the key services are all serverless and they're all managed infrastructure.

34
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:53,540
So in this course,

35
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,315
we will show you how to build batch and streaming data pipelines.

36
00:01:57,315 --> 00:02:00,070
By building your data pipelines on Google Cloud,

37
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,545
you essentially get to take advantage of the scalability,

38
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:06,290
reliability, and sheer engineering

39
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,640
prowess that Google brings to running machine learning systems.
