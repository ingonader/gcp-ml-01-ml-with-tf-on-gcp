This course on how to do machine learning is taught by Googlers who work in machine learning. So why would you look to Google and Googlers to learn about ML? Well, at Google we apply machine learning and pretty much all of our products. We're teaching this course so that we can share some of what we've learned. And we're super excited to see what you build based on what you learn in this set of courses. Of course, we hope you build on Google Cloud. Machine learning has completely transformed the way we, Google that is, do business, including how we approach new and existing products, how we design our products, and how we approach new challenges. Many of you probably interact with Google services, photos, Youtube, Gmail, Inbox, you interact with these Google services every day. All those services benefit from, and in some cases, they depend upon machine learning. We keep track of how much we use machine learning, deep learning in particular. And over the last few years, we have produced over 4,000 TensorFlow machine learning model. You heard that right, 4,000. There are over 4,000 TensorFlow machine learning models in production at Google. In 2012, that number was near zero. And by the end of 2016, we are crossing 4,000. So in this specialization, you will learn to use the technology we use. And this course covers how our engineers infuse machine learning into our products.
