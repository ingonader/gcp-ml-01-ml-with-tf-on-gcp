Hi, I'm Max.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,030
I'm a Machine Learning Consultant at Google,

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,820
and I teach clients about how,

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,040
and when to apply ML to their business challenges.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,535
In this module, I'll be walking you through how to optimize your ML models.

6
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:17,915
Let's first start with what you're going to learn.

7
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:22,010
Taking a brief look at where we are on the course as a whole,

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,335
you'll see we're almost halfway through.

9
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:27,090
In this module, you'll learn about how to measure

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,185
model performance subjectively using loss functions,

11
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:34,660
use loss functions as the basis for an algorithm called gradient descent,

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,730
optimize gradient descent to be as efficient as possible,

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,000
and use performance metrics to make business decisions.
