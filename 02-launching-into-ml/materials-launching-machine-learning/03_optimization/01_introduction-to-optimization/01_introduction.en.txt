Hi, I'm Max. I'm a Machine Learning Consultant at Google, and I teach clients about how, and when to apply ML to their business challenges. In this module, I'll be walking you through how to optimize your ML models. Let's first start with what you're going to learn. Taking a brief look at where we are on the course as a whole, you'll see we're almost halfway through. In this module, you'll learn about how to measure model performance subjectively using loss functions, use loss functions as the basis for an algorithm called gradient descent, optimize gradient descent to be as efficient as possible, and use performance metrics to make business decisions.
