00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,525
Hello and welcome again to the course.

2
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:04,500
Before we get too deep into the lectures here,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,080
I wanted to preview the interactive hands-on labs platform called Qwiklabs and how

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,160
you're actually be practicing a lot of the things that you're going to learn

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,975
here inside of real Google Cloud Platform accounts.

6
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,300
But you don't need your own credentials,

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,825
those are actually going to be provided for you.

8
00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:19,200
So, let's take a look at how the labs platform is setup.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,100
Inside of Coursera, you're actually going to see a lab or an item

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,150
that's marked out for an external tool to open up and you're going to click on that tool.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,410
After that, you're going to see a "Start Lab " button in green and

12
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,805
a timer associated with it for you to complete the lab in that duration.

13
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:37,440
After you click that "Start Lab" credentials for your student accounts

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,155
will automatically going to be provided to you in a new box that's going to pop up.

15
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:44,130
In addition, there's another button that says "Open Google

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,020
Console" in yellow and once you open that up,

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,140
that's going to ask you to log into the Google Cloud Platform with

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,690
the key caveat that you're logging in with

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,240
a student account and not your own personal account,

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,875
should you already have one setup.

21
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,290
And last but not least, we'll do a few demos and

22
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,620
walkthroughs of what the UI looks like. So, let's take a look.

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,320
So, inside an example Coursera course,

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,400
you're going to come across a lab that looks something like this.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,120
This is just an example, this is lab zero,

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,955
but it could be any of the labs that you might find.

27
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:12,550
Once you've clicked on that,

28
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,580
you'll see a checkbox that's going to authorize the lab to run and you

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,160
accept the terms and conditions for Coursera and you

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,930
click on "Open Tool" and once you click "Open tool",

31
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,080
that's going to bring you to the Qwiklabs environment

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,510
and a couple of key things to notice here.

33
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,800
On the right hand side is

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,260
your instructions pane for the actual lab and this labs and metal lab,

35
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,765
it's all about Qwiklabs in general,

36
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:35,225
but whatever your course is,

37
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:38,460
this is where the instructions for completing the lab are going to take place.

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,065
So, you always want to keep this prompt open.

39
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:43,615
Now, once you actually click "Start Lab",

40
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:47,940
a provisioned instance of the Google Cloud Platform complete with

41
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,890
any additional instances or say you're working with VMs,

42
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,525
if there's something that the lab provider wanted you to have,

43
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:57,660
it's actually going to be created inside of this lab instance

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,170
for you which is great, sandbox instance.

45
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,800
Now, once you notice, I click "Start Lab",

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,720
I have 15 minutes to complete this lab.

47
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,760
I promise you that the timers are going to be associated

48
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,040
with additional padding for the labs that you're going to do.

49
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,630
This is going to make it to take us 15 minutes,

50
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,115
thi will take us maybe about five minutes.

51
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:12,720
Now, as I mentioned before,

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,815
you have the username and password and a Project ID.

53
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:18,140
What I'll ask you to do now is click on "Open Google

54
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,950
Console" and once you've opened Google Console,

55
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,480
you'll be asked to sign in with your email.

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,320
Now, the key thing here is if you use Google resources before,

57
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,870
immediately it'll start typing in your personal email. I do it all the time.

58
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,419
Make sure you go back to your lab credentials

59
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,260
screen and copy and paste the username that's auto-generated for you.

60
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,070
It's going to be unique for you and it's

61
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,040
actually going to be unique for every lab that you run.

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,910
So you're going to be creating a new student count for each lab that you run.

63
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,020
Copy and paste that password, it's going to be different from mine,

64
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,855
so don't worry about copying that down.

65
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:49,150
Click "Next" in your browser,

66
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,170
paste in that password, accept the terms.

67
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,620
Don't worry about setting up a secondary phone number.

68
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,260
Accept the terms of

69
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,690
the Google Cloud Platform and once you

70
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,530
see a screen that looks like this, then, you're good to go.

71
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,795
Make sure, key tidbit,

72
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:10,910
is this is your project's selector,

73
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,305
it should be this auto-generated Qwiklabs alphanumeric.

74
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:17,210
If you should happen to see something that says "Either select a

75
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,525
project" or if you see something that says "Qwiklabs resources",

76
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:23,490
you actually want to click on this and make sure to

77
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,120
select your alphanumeric Qwiklabs ID and then go ahead and hit "Open".

78
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,145
Once you're within here, you're good to go.

79
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:30,880
So, follow the instructions for the rest of the lab.

80
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,010
It's going to guide you through

81
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,195
what products and services that you're going to be working with.

82
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:37,805
You can access the menu of products and services in the upper left hand corner here,

83
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:40,030
or if it's a lab that's working with Cloud Shell.

84
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,870
All the way up here is the button to activate Cloud Shell which

85
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,915
will bring open that terminal instance for Google Cloud Platform.

86
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:48,390
Last few things, back here,

87
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,835
you'll see that our timer is automatically running still.

88
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:52,710
Once you're completed with a lab,

89
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,150
you're done with it,

90
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,580
or if you wanted to take another attempt at the lab,

91
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,325
you have upwards of three attempts per lab, which is great.

92
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:01,790
So say, you want to run through the lab very quickly the first time,

93
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,950
and then experiment and explore with it the second time.

94
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,280
You're welcome to do that for a couple of times.

95
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,000
Now, make sure in order to get your completion stats properly recorded,

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,385
click on "End Lab".

97
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,095
You'll be faced with a prompt that says "Are you all done?".

98
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:15,415
Once you click "End Lab",

99
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:17,275
your project, any data sets,

100
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:18,800
anything that you've been working with inside of

101
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,490
this Sandbox project is going to be deleted.

102
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,750
So, make sure if you have any queries that you're running

103
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,940
or any interesting notes that you have saved inside you to

104
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,040
Google Cloud Platform Qwiklabs account

105
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,085
that you copy and paste those and save them somewhere else.

106
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,905
Perhaps in your own personal Google Cloud Platform account

107
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:35,615
or somewhere locally on your machine,

108
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:38,200
and once you've clicked "End Lab" then,

109
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,270
you can enter feedback for the lab and you can

110
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,505
continue moving on with rest of the courses in Coursera.

111
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:43,870
So again, quick recap,

112
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,375
the key things to remember is click on "Open Tool" that'll open up Qwiklabs.

113
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,440
The second is, in order to get those credentials here on the left-hand side,

114
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,430
you have to click "Start Lab" which again kicks off the timer,

115
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,335
and there's no way to pause when lab is started but again keep in mind,

116
00:04:57,335 --> 00:04:58,820
you have multiple attempts.

117
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,940
Lastly, click on "End Lab" when you're ready to

118
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,560
completely complete out the lab that you've been working on.

119
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,250
That's it. Good luck with the labs that come later on and enjoy the course.
