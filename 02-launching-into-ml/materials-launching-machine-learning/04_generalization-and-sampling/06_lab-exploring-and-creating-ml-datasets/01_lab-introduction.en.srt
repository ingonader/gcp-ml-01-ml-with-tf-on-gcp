1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,210
Our goal in this next lab is to estimate taxi fare in New York City.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,530
Alright. So I've got to set expectations here.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,420
This is not going to be an easy problem.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,240
It's going to take us a long time and lots of learning on the models part,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,100
to get to the point where we can beat a simple benchmark with

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,215
machine learning. What are going to have to do?

7
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:20,165
Well first, we've got to get the data.

8
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:22,745
We've got to understand it, clean it, pre-process it,

9
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:24,910
and then everything you didn't the last lab,

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,110
where you split it into repeatable segments,

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,830
like training evaluation and testing, you're going to have to do again.

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,610
Next, when we're ready for ML model building,

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,290
you need to decide what ML model you're going to use to predict the cost of a cab ride.

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,240
Finally, in order to beat our benchmark metric for model performance,

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,020
we'll then need to fine tune and adjust the model to get the best results.

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,155
Squeeze out those last bits of performance.

17
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:49,200
Note that good benchmarking here is going to be absolutely critical.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,020
We're going to have to establish a baseline using

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,630
a simple ML model that we'll then have to beat

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,260
with our model with more advanced insights and tuning.

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,370
Now a benchmark is like a simple algorithm.

22
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,110
If I just asked you an RMSE of

23
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,615
three dollars is that good or not? Well, you might not know.

24
00:01:06,615 --> 00:01:09,655
That's why having well-thought-out benchmarks is a critical step in

25
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:14,930
ML performance and helps us determine whether or not our greatest model is good enough.

26
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,635
What's a good benchmark for a taxi fare prediction?

27
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:20,580
Perhaps you could compute say,

28
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,970
the distance between the pickup point and the drop off

29
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,845
point and multiply it by a constant,

30
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:28,610
like cost per kilometer and cost per mile and then we're done.

31
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,670
Alright. That seems like a reasonable benchmark.

32
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,675
We'll do that and then we'll have to beat it with a better model.

33
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:37,380
Exploring, creating those data sets and then benchmarking.

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,570
Those are the three fundamental steps that you are

35
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,620
going to take for any ML project they're going to take.

36
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,690
And you're offering to spend a weeks just exploring the data set to

37
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,260
gain that intuition and insight into the problem that you're trying to solve.

38
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,550
You need to understand what the data is before you attempt to model it.

39
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,145
Now this benchmarking phase should not be neglected.

40
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:55,690
If you don't have a good benchmark,

41
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,965
you don't know what is good performance or bad performance.

42
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:01,615
And many times errors can be detected simply by

43
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:05,375
realizing that your performance is nowhere near the benchmark.

44
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,330
Go ahead and get started with this lab,

45
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,085
check you work against the solution,

46
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:14,850
and then come back we'll do a walkthrough together when you're ready. Good luck.
