1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,780
In this lab, you'll explore the impact of

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,515
different ways of creating machine learning data sets.

3
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:08,270
Repeatability is important in machine learning.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,775
Imagine you started making changes in your model,

5
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:12,615
like to your parameters and hyperparameters.

6
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:17,100
And meanwhile, the underlying data on subsequent training runs is also changing.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,905
You'll be unable to tell whether or not your model is performing better,

8
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:24,095
based on the actual performance of the models performing better,

9
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:27,030
or the snapshot of data that it used for that one training run,

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,040
was easier because the data is changing.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,730
By keeping the data constant as we change the model,

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,445
you can tweak and tune your model,

13
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:34,715
and then run it again,

14
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:37,290
on the exact same experimentation data set.

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,240
In this lab, you'll practice how to create,

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,935
split, and hold these data sets constant.

17
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:44,880
So, give it a go.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,070
Now, the solutions to all of these labs are in the code repository in GitHub.

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,900
This is all open source,

20
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,470
and you'll have access to the repository even after you finish this course.

21
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,445
And we highly encourages you,

22
00:00:57,445 --> 00:01:00,650
as I like to say, "Good artists copy, great artists steal."

23
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,410
So, feel free to use this code as a starting point for any of your future ML projects.

24
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,270
All right. Give that lab a try and then come back for the solution walk through.
