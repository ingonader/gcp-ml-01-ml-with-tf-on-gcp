Hi, I'm Ryan.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,170
I'm a machine learning scientist at Google,

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,100
and I love applying math and

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,475
machine learning to big data to better make sense of the world.

5
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:13,320
In this module, I will introduce some of the main types of machine learning,

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,460
and review the history of ML,

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,930
leading up to the state of the art so that you can

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,090
accelerate your growth as an ML practitioner.

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,830
There are many problems in the world just waiting to be

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,630
solved with abundant data and machine learning algorithms.

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,020
However, with such a wide assortment of model types to choose from,

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,855
what is the right tool for the job?

13
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:34,170
In this module, you will learn how to

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,745
differentiate between the major categories of ML problems,

15
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:40,125
and how to apply them in practice.

16
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:44,110
Machine Learning has undergone tremendous growth and popularity over

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,030
the last several decades leading to

18
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,920
the current exciting results of deep learning with the ML networks.

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,795
You will learn not only how machine learning has evolved through history,

20
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:57,550
but also the tricks and techniques learned along the way that have

21
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,610
been leverage to help get the state of the art such amazing performance today.

22
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:07,210
Lastly, we're going to identify why deep learning is currently so popular and see how

23
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,940
Google has transformed itself by incorporating

24
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,000
deep learning models across all of our products.
