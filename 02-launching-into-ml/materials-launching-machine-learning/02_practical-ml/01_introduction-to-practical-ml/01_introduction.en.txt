Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm a machine learning scientist at Google, and I love applying math and machine learning to big data to better make sense of the world. In this module, I will introduce some of the main types of machine learning, and review the history of ML, leading up to the state of the art so that you can accelerate your growth as an ML practitioner. There are many problems in the world just waiting to be solved with abundant data and machine learning algorithms. However, with such a wide assortment of model types to choose from, what is the right tool for the job? In this module, you will learn how to differentiate between the major categories of ML problems, and how to apply them in practice. Machine Learning has undergone tremendous growth and popularity over the last several decades leading to the current exciting results of deep learning with the ML networks. You will learn not only how machine learning has evolved through history, but also the tricks and techniques learned along the way that have been leverage to help get the state of the art such amazing performance today. Lastly, we're going to identify why deep learning is currently so popular and see how Google has transformed itself by incorporating deep learning models across all of our products.
