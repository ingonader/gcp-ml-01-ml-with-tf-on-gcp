Hello. I'm Valiapa Lakshmanan. Everyone calls me Lak. The tool that we will use to write Machine Learning programs is TensorFlow. And so, in this course we, my coauthors and I, will introduce you to TensorFlow. This is the third course of the Machine Learning on GCP specialization. In the first course, you learned how to formulate business problems as Machine Learning problems. And in the second course, you learned how Machine Learning works in practice and how to create, Machine Learning datasets that you can use. But now that you have the data in place, you are ready to get started writing Machine Learning programs. So, in this course you will learn how to create Machine Learning models in TensorFlow. We will start off by talking about core TensorFlow. This is TensorFlow as a numeric programming library. You will learn how to use the TensorFlow libraries to solve numerical problems. When writing programs you often want to know about common mistakes that you might run into and how to fix common errors. So, you will learn how to troubleshoot and debug common TensorFlow called pitfalls. And then we will look at the Estimator API which provides the highest level of abstraction within TensorFlow for training, evaluating, and serving ML models. You will learn how to use tf_estimator to create train and evaluate a Machine Learning model. Finally, you will learn how to execute the TensorFlow models that you create on Cloud ML Engine. This is Google managed infrastructure to run TensorFlow. You will learn how to train, deploy, and productionalize machine learning models at scale with Cloud Machine Learning Engine. So, let's get started with TensorFlow.
