00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,090
Hello. I'm Valiapa Lakshmanan.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,605
Everyone calls me Lak.

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:08,775
The tool that we will use to write Machine Learning programs is TensorFlow.

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,620
And so, in this course we,

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,180
my coauthors and I,

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,295
will introduce you to TensorFlow.

7
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:18,765
This is the third course of the Machine Learning on GCP specialization.

8
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:20,520
In the first course,

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,990
you learned how to formulate business problems as Machine Learning problems.

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,635
And in the second course,

11
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:31,200
you learned how Machine Learning works in practice and how to create,

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,275
Machine Learning datasets that you can use.

13
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:36,500
But now that you have the data in place,

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,275
you are ready to get started writing Machine Learning programs.

15
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:46,695
So, in this course you will learn how to create Machine Learning models in TensorFlow.

16
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:50,770
We will start off by talking about core TensorFlow.

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,460
This is TensorFlow as a numeric programming library.

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,510
You will learn how to use the TensorFlow libraries to solve numerical problems.

19
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,400
When writing programs you often want to know about

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,300
common mistakes that you might run into and how to fix common errors.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,700
So, you will learn how to troubleshoot and debug common TensorFlow called pitfalls.

22
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,200
And then we will look at the Estimator API which provides

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,370
the highest level of abstraction within TensorFlow for training,

24
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,595
evaluating, and serving ML models.

25
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:32,030
You will learn how to use tf_estimator to

26
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,960
create train and evaluate a Machine Learning model.

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,895
Finally, you will learn how to execute

28
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:44,945
the TensorFlow models that you create on Cloud ML Engine.

29
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:48,825
This is Google managed infrastructure to run TensorFlow.

30
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:51,765
You will learn how to train, deploy,

31
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:58,570
and productionalize machine learning models at scale with Cloud Machine Learning Engine.

32
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,420
So, let's get started with TensorFlow.
