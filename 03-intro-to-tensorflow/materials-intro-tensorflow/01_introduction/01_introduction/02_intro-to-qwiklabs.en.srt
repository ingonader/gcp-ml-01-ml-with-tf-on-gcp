1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,610
Hello and welcome again, to the course.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,520
Before we get too deep
in the lectures here,

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,890
I want to preview the interactive hands
on labs platform called Qwiklabs, and

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,780
how you'll actually be practicing a lot of
the things that you're going to learn here

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,060
inside of real
Google Cloud Platform accounts.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,398
But you don't need your own credentials,

7
00:00:15,398 --> 00:00:16,857
those are actually going to
be provided for you.

8
00:00:16,857 --> 00:00:19,430
So, just take a look at how
the lab platform is set up.

9
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,630
Inside of Coursera,
you're actually going to see a lab or

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,580
an item that's marked out for
an external tool to open up, and

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,300
you're going to click on that tool.

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,390
After that you're going to see
a Start Lab button in green and

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,080
a timer associated with it for
you to complete the lab in that duration.

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,420
After you click that Start Lab,
credentials for your student accounts

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,360
are automatically going to be provided
to you in a new box is going to pop up.

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,430
In addition, there's going to
be another button that says

17
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,910
Open Google Console in yellow.

18
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,030
And once you open that up,

19
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,775
that's going to ask you to log
in to the Google Cloud Platform

20
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:52,905
with the key caveat and
you log in with a student account and

21
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:56,175
not your personal account should
you already have one set up.

22
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:57,075
And last but not the least,

23
00:00:57,075 --> 00:01:00,225
we'll do a few demos and
walk-throughs of what the UI looks like.

24
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:00,775
So, let's take a look.

25
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:03,765
So, inside an example Coursera course,

26
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:07,545
you're going to come across a lab
that looks something like this.

27
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:09,125
This is just an example, this is lab 0 but

28
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,155
it could be any of the labs
that you might find.

29
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,860
Once you clicked on that,

30
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,450
you'll see a check box that's
going to authorize the lab to run and

31
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,690
you accept the terms and conditions for
Coursera and you click on Open Tool.

32
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,270
And once you click open tool, it's going
to bring you to the Qwiklabs environment

33
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,760
and a couple of key things to notice here.

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,040
On the right hand side is your
instructions paying for the actual lab.

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,880
Now this lab's a medal lab,
it's all about Qwiklabs in general.

36
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,624
But whatever you course is,
this is what the instructions for

37
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:38,487
completing the lab
are going to take place.

38
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:41,360
So you always want to
keep this prompt open.

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,450
Now once you actually click Start Lab,
a provision instance of the Google Cloud

40
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,880
platform complete with any additional
instances or say you're working with VMs.

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,408
If there is something that the lab
provider wanted you to have,

42
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:58,175
it's actually going to be created
inside of this lab instance for you,

43
00:01:58,175 --> 00:02:00,242
which is a great thing,
it's a Sandbox instance.

44
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:03,700
Now, once you noticed I click Start Lab,
I have 15 minutes to complete this lab.

45
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,744
I promise you that the timers are going to
be associated with additional padding for

46
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:07,962
the labs that you're going to do.

47
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,557
This isn't going to mean it's
going to take us 15 minutes,

48
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:10,825
this will take as maybe
about five minutes.

49
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:14,991
Style-wise, I mentioned before,
you have the username and password, and

50
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:15,769
a project ID.

51
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,550
What I'll ask you to do now is
click on Open Google Console.

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,784
And once you've opened Google Console,

53
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:25,137
you'll be be asked to
sign up with your email.

54
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:28,265
Now the key thing here is if you use
google resources before immediately you

55
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:31,536
start typing your personal email I do it
all the time make sure you go back to your

56
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:35,134
lab credentials screen and copy and paste
the user name that's autogenerated here.

57
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:38,046
It's going to be unique for you and
it's actually going to be unique for

58
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:39,090
every lab that you run.

59
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,160
So it we'll be creating a new soon
account for each lab that you run.

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,180
Copy and paste that password which is
going to be different from mine, so

61
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,290
don't worry about copying that down.

62
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,204
Click Next in your browser,
paste in that password, accept the terms,

63
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:59,247
Don't worry about setting up
a secondary phone number,

64
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:03,260
accept the terms of
the Google Cloud Platform.

65
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,760
And once you see a screen that looks
like this, then you're good to go.

66
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,980
Make sure, key tidbit,
is this is your project selector,

67
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,522
it should be this auto generated
Qwiklabs alpha numeric.

68
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:18,610
If you happen to see something that says
either select a project or if you see

69
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,460
something that says Qwiklabs resources,
you actually want to click on this.

70
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,557
And make sure to select your alphanumeric
Qwiklabs' ID, and then go ahead and

71
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:27,128
hit open.

72
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:29,120
Once you're within here you're good to go.

73
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
So follow the instructions for
the rest of the lab.

74
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,650
It's going to guide you
through what products and

75
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,300
services you're going to be working with.

76
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,980
You can access the menu of products and
services in the upper left hand

77
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,190
corner here, or if it's a lab
that's working for Cloud Shell.

78
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,630
All the way up here,
is the button to activate Cloud Shell,

79
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,150
which will open up that terminal
instance for Google Cloud Platform.

80
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,990
Last few things, back here, you see that
our timer is automatically running still,

81
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,140
once you're completed with the lab,
you're done with it.

82
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,030
Or if you wanted to take
a another attempt at the lab,

83
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,460
you have upwards of three attempts for
lab which is great.

84
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,790
So say you want to run to the lab
very quickly the first time and

85
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,090
then experiment and
explore within the second time.

86
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,530
You are welcome to do that for
a couple of times.

87
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,620
Now make sure in order to get completion
starts properly recorded click on End Lab.

88
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,260
You'll be faced with a prompt that says,
are you all done?

89
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,040
Once you click End Lab, your project,
any data sets, anything that you've been

90
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,720
working with inside of this Ssandbox
project is going to be deleted.

91
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,840
So make sure if you have any
queries that you're running or

92
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,420
any interesting that you have saved inside
of your Google Cloud Platform Qwiklabs'

93
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,350
account, that you copy and paste those and
save them some where else.

94
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,120
Perhaps in your own personal
Google Cloud Platform account or

95
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,890
some where locally on our machine.

96
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,030
And once you've clicked End Lab,
then you can add feedback for the lab, and

97
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,710
you can continue moving around
the rest of the course in Coursera.

98
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,060
So again, quick recap, the only key
things to remember is click and

99
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,500
Open Tool that will open up Qwiklabs.

100
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,522
The second is in order to get those
credentials here on the left hand side,

101
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:54,177
you have to click Start Lab,
which again, kicks off the timer.

102
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:56,692
And there's no way to pause once
the lab has started, but again,

103
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,760
keep in mind you have multiple attempts.

104
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,630
And lastly,
click on End Lab when you're ready to

105
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,770
complete out the lab that
you've been working on.

106
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,920
That's it, good luck with the labs that
come later on and enjoy the course.
