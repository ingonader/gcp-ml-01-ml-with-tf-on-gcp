00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,565
Let's do a quick recap of the TensorFlow code and concepts we've covered in this course.

2
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:08,980
We started with core TensorFlow where you learned how to write

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,070
lazy evaluation and imperative programs.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,245
You worked with graphs, sessions,

5
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:17,305
and variables, and did a bit of debugging in your labs.

6
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:20,585
Then we moved onto the estimator API where we created

7
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:24,255
production-ready machine learning models the easy way,

8
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:27,370
and learned how to train on large datasets that do not fit

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,875
in memory and monitor them inside tensor board.

10
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,640
Lastly, we ended with how to scale

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,640
our distributed TensorFlow models with Cloud ML Engine.

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,180
Recall that fundamentally, TensorFlow is an open source,

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,135
high performance library for numerical computation,

14
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:49,025
not just machine learning, any numerical computation.

15
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:53,460
Let's revisit this diagram we've covered on your TensorFlow hierarchy.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,060
As you saw in your labs,

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,530
you were largely working with higher levels of abstraction when writing model code.

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,140
Mostly, we build our ML models using the estimator API.

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,630
Recall that it knows how to do distributed training.

20
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,885
It knows how to evaluate,

21
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:08,160
how to create a checkpoint,

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,945
how to save a model and how to set up TensorFlow serving.

23
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:15,900
It comes with everything done in a sensible way that fits most ML models and production.

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,955
Regardless of which abstraction layer you are writing your TensorFlow code at,

25
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:24,210
seemingly gives you a managed service, its hosted TensorFlow.

26
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,990
So you can write it on the cloud,

27
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:31,225
on a cluster of machines without having to install any software or manage any servers.

28
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:35,760
We discussed the training and serving infrastructure you would need to

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,840
set up yourself if you wanted to host and run your own production models.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,510
Cloud ML Engine get you the machines you need

31
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,320
whether CPUs or GPUs or TPUs when you need them.

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
It simplifies the bookkeeping and ensures that

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,705
the train models which you actually run at prediction time.

34
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:55,430
It's a highly scalable service that makes distributed training easy.

35
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,200
Not just training, though, also serving.

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,630
On cloud, we can scale to zero machines or

37
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,725
as many as you need to handle the large number of queries per second.

38
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:10,990
We practiced deploying and serving our taxi fare prediction model on cloud ML engine.

39
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,475
Well, that's a wrap on TensorFlow basics.

40
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,720
Join us for the next course where you will learn how to do

41
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,270
feature engineering so as to improve the performance of your models.
