1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,220
In this lab,

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:06,230
we take a previously developed TensorFlow
model to predict taxi fare rides, and

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,900
package it up so that it can be run
on Cloud Machine Learning Engine.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,740
For now we'll run this
on a small data set.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,920
The model that was developed
is rather simplistic, and

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,790
therefore the accuracy of
the model's not great either.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,730
However, this lab will illustrate
the basics of running TensorFlow models

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,290
on Cloud ML.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,700
Specifically, we'll cover how to
package up a TensorFlow model,

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,970
run training locally,
run training on Cloud,

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:36,120
deploy the model to Cloud, and
invoke the model to carry out predictions.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,240
Practice the lab yourself by reading
through the notebook comments and

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,130
executing the code cells.

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,360
I encourage you to edit the code to ensure
you understand what each part does.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,580
And then come back to the wrap up video,
where we'll walk through it together.
