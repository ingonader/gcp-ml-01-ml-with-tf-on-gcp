Hi, I'm Josh Cogan,

2
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:04,725
a software engineer on the Cloud AI team.

3
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:07,200
I work on AutoML, for image classification.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,670
And at this point, I have probably automatically

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,220
trained and deployed more TensorFlow models,

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,495
on CloudML engine than anyone else.

7
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:17,860
Today, I want to talk about how to take your TensorFlow model,

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,315
train and deploy it on GCP's managed machine learning infrastructure.

9
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:26,635
In this module, we'll discuss how to train a model on Google Cloud,

10
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:28,495
monitor that model training,

11
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,980
and finally deploy it as a micro service.
