Hi, I'm Josh Cogan, a software engineer on the Cloud AI team. I work on AutoML, for image classification. And at this point, I have probably automatically trained and deployed more TensorFlow models, on CloudML engine than anyone else. Today, I want to talk about how to take your TensorFlow model, train and deploy it on GCP's managed machine learning infrastructure. In this module, we'll discuss how to train a model on Google Cloud, monitor that model training, and finally deploy it as a micro service.
