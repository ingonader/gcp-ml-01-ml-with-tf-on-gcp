1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,735
So here I am in the GitHub repository of the course.

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:06,270
And I'm in the 03_TensorFlow,

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,190
this chapters that we're doing.

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,900
And let me go ahead and open the debug_demo.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,885
And let's look at some of the things that we talked about in the chapter.

6
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:21,505
So here, let me go ahead and import TensorFlow.

7
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:24,430
And here's a first example that we looked at.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,420
We had data and we were basically slicing and getting all of the rows of data,

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,670
and we were getting two of the columns and

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,895
see we are getting all of the rows but we're getting only one column,

11
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:37,025
and so now when we add a and c,

12
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:39,415
we're going to run into a shape error,

13
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,570
and that's exactly what we run into.

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:48,070
And you notice that at the very bottom of the stack trace the error message,

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,670
you get your value error.

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,255
Dimensions must be equal,

17
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:52,470
but they are two and four.

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,805
The first one is a 2D tensor for coma two,

19
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,595
the second one is a 1D tensor of four.

20
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:01,180
And then when you walk up the stack trace,

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,330
you'll see that this particular one;

22
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,910
common_shapes.python, this is not ours,

23
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,605
this is way back in TensorFlow.

24
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:08,910
So we can't ignore it.

25
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,895
This one's also in TensorFlow so we can ignore it.

26
00:01:11,895 --> 00:01:17,255
As is this, this one is also TensorFlow so is that.

27
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:21,060
So this is all TensorFlow we can keep ignoring it and I'm keeping on

28
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,480
scrolling until I find something that's in my code.

29
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,770
So there is sum method and that's in

30
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,870
my code and there is the method called s equals a plus c,

31
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,885
it's pointing out that this is the problem.

32
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,790
And this of course gets called from session that

33
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,695
run but we're going ignore that because that's the problem here,

34
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,850
s equals a plus c. So let's go ahead and

35
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,505
look at this and say where could the value error have happened.

36
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:48,500
And we go in and we say s equals a plus c all right, right.

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,015
If you're adding two things and we know that according to linear algebra rules,

38
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:56,120
when we added two tensors they have to have the exact same shape,

39
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,380
that's the only way it works.

40
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,845
So now we can go ahead and try to fix it.

41
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:08,795
So in this case what I'm doing is I'm going to go ahead and create fake data,

42
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,150
I'm passing in my fake data that is my,

43
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,090
what is the shape here?

44
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,815
It's a four by three matrix.

45
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:23,605
I'm passing it in and I'm passing going ahead and getting s shape printing out c shape.

46
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:25,865
And now let me go ahead and run this cell.

47
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:27,430
And when I run the cell,

48
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,440
I basically get that the shape of a is four coma two and the shape of c is four and

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,860
that tells me okay I now know what was

50
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,680
a problem and then question becomes how do I fix it?

51
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,565
And the way that you would fix it,

52
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:44,450
is to basically make sure that both of these are the same shape.

53
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,590
So I might get 0-2 in the first instance,

54
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,840
and 1-3, in other words the sliding window,

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,495
we are removing the one each time.

56
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:53,620
The stride, when we talk about

57
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,150
images you will basically learn about this term ''the stride''.

58
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,470
The stride is one and the size of my window is two.

59
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,150
So that's exactly what I'm doing.

60
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,620
And now when I run it,

61
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,220
it should work perfectly and I basically get

62
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,800
back the sum that is a result of the sliding window.

63
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,315
So that is essentially the process that you go through to debug your code.

64
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:15,270
Read the call trace,

65
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,745
read the error message,

66
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:19,780
find out where problem is and having found out the problem,

67
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,165
fix it, make sure that it works on your fake data.

68
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:28,265
And then you can try it back on your full large data set and hopefully everything works.

69
00:03:28,265 --> 00:03:33,460
Similarly, we talked about a type error and that's exactly the same process.

70
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,555
In this case, I'm adding a and b,

71
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:38,285
a is basically floating point numbers,

72
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,029
b is basically integers,

73
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:41,245
it's not going to work.

74
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:43,490
And then I'm going to go ahead and look at these [inaudible] ,

75
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,825
look at the error message and learn that in order to fix it,

76
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:52,470
one way would be to take b which is originally just integers and go ahead and do a cast.

77
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,945
And we're going to do the cast,

78
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:57,260
things will work, and that is the basic idea here.
