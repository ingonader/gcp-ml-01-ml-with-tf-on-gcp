00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,845
Besides the shape errors that we looked at in the previous lessons,

2
00:00:03,845 --> 00:00:06,435
another common error that you will run into

3
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:10,325
when developing TensorFlow programs are data type errors.

4
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:13,170
The error message here says that you have

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,490
a Tensor whose values are all stored as integer arrays,

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,695
but you're passing it to a method that expects a Tensor to have floating point values.

7
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:25,120
Where might something like this happen?

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,730
Perhaps you look at the call trace and the line of code

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,910
that gets identified is the addition line here,

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,950
s equals a plus b.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:40,225
So, maybe a is an array of floats while b is an array of ints.

12
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:43,959
Now, you're thinking that you can add a floating point number to an integer,

13
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,060
no problem, this should be automatic,

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,245
the result is a floating point number.

15
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:56,540
But neither Python nor C++ lets you out of floating point array to an integer array.

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,750
There's a lot of storage optimizations involved,

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,420
and if you have an integer array the data might be stored on a device or

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,450
part of memory where it's simply not possible to do floating point arithmetic.

19
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,230
So, you've got to fix it.

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,500
Are you going to round off the floating point values to integers?

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,690
So, did you make a mistake and

22
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,155
the floating-point array was really supposed to be an integer array?

23
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:21,965
Or do you want to cast the integers to floating point values

24
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:26,040
and do the addition knowing that the result is now a floating point array?

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,860
Because there are several possible choices here,

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,950
TensorFlow is asking you to be more clear.

27
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,690
So, one way to fix the problem is to take the integer array b and

28
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,730
say that we now want it to be a Tensor of floating point values.

29
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,430
So, this call to tf dot cast will get inserted into the computation graph and

30
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,880
the optimizations etc will take that into account when

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,140
deciding where to store b and how to move b around.

32
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,840
So here, we are adding the tf dot cast operation into the method to fix it.
