1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
In this lab, you will learn how the TenserFlow Python API works.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,525
You will learn how to build graph,

3
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:07,860
how to run a graph,

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,840
and how to feed values into the graph.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,500
And then, you will put all this together to write a program,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,950
to find the area of a triangle using TenserFlow.
