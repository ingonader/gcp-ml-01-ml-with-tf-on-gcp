1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Let's start by explaining what is TensorFlow.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,490
TensorFlow is an open source,

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,455
high performance, library for numerical computation.

4
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:13,840
It's not just about machine learning.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,625
It's about any numeric computation.

6
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:21,835
Infact,, people have used TensorFlow for all kinds of GPU computing.

7
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:27,025
For example, you can use TensorFlow to solve partial differential equations.

8
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:30,115
These are useful in domains like fluid dynamics.

9
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:34,435
Tensorflow as a numeric program library is appealing,

10
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:38,040
because you can write your competition code in a high level language,

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,955
Python for example, and have it be executed in a fast way.

12
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:49,195
The way TensorFlow works is that you create a directed acyclic graph, a DAG.

13
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:51,410
To represent your computation.

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,830
In this schematic, the nodes represent mathematical operations.

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,815
Things like adding, subtracting, multiplying et cetera.

16
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:03,405
Also more complex functions.

17
00:01:03,405 --> 00:01:07,510
Here for example you see soft max matrix multiplication.

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,030
These are all mathematical operations that are

19
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,190
part of the directed acyclic graph, the DAG.

20
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,770
Connecting the nodes in the DAG are the edges,

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,980
the input and the output of mathematical operations.

22
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,030
The edges represent arrays of data.

23
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,175
Essentially the result of computing across

24
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:31,945
entropy is one of the three inputs to the bias add

25
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:34,890
operation and the output of the bias and

26
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,465
operation is sent along the matrix multiplication operation,

27
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:41,405
matmul in the diagram.

28
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:43,690
The other input to matmul,

29
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,975
you need to input your matrix multiplication.

30
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:49,750
The other input is a variable, the weight.

31
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,960
So where does the name TensorFlow come from.

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,165
In math a simple number like three or five is called a scalar.

33
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:02,300
A vector is a one dimensional array of such numbers.

34
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,575
In physics a vector is something magnitude and direction,

35
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:10,050
but in computer science we've used vector to mean 1D arrays.

36
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,870
A two-dimensional array is a matrix,

37
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,210
but the three-dimensional array,

38
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,885
we just call it a 3D tensor.

39
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:22,350
So scalar, vector, matrix 3D tensor,

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,300
4D tensor et cetera.

41
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,155
A tensor is an n dimensional array of data.

42
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:31,910
So your data in TensorFlow, they are tensors.

43
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:38,220
They flow through the directed acyclic graph, hence TensorFlow.
