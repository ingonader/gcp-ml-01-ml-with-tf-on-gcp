00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,700
Here, we will introduce you to the core components of

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,365
TensorFlow and get hands on practice building machine learning programs.

4
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:15,500
Most TensorFlow production programs work in a lazy evaluation mode.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,190
Although, you might find yourself developing

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,640
your programs in eager mode, which is imperative.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,675
You will learn what I mean when I say lazy evaluation imperative,

8
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:30,470
and learn how to write lazy evaluation and imperative programs.

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,580
Lazy evaluation means that TensorFlow works of

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,380
variables that are parts of graphs that are tied to sessions.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,410
You will learn what these concepts mean and how to

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,940
work with graphs, sessions, and variables.

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,425
Understanding how well a machine learning model is doing will require you to views

14
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:55,340
KLR numbers like losses and weights over the course of training as a chart.

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,355
You also typically want to look at things called embeddings,

16
00:00:59,355 --> 00:01:03,135
or projectors, and the architecture of your model.

17
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:09,165
In this chapter, you will also learn how to visualize TensorFlow graphs.

18
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:12,900
Finally, things aren't always smooth and easy.

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,530
When you're writing code,

20
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,005
you will run into programs that don't compile or worse,

21
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:21,190
programs that crash on some specific data input.

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,820
So, you will learn how to debug TensorFlow programs.
