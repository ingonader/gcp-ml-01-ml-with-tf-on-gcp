1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,295
In this lab, we will write our first model using the estimator API.

2
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:10,440
You will learn how to define input features for the model using feature columns,

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,870
how to pick a pre-made estimator,

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,190
and how to train it on a small demo data set that fits in memory.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,920
Practice with the lab yourself by reading through

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,020
the notebook comments and executing the code cells.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,705
I encourage you to edit the code to ensure you understand what each part does,

8
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:33,000
then come back to the wrap-up video where we'll walk through it together.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,690
Note that you have three attempts to complete the lab.

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,520
So, don't worry if you run out of time on your first attempt.
