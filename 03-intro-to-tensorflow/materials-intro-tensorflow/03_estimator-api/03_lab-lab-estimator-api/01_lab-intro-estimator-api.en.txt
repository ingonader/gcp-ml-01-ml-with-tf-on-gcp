In this lab, we will write our first model using the estimator API. You will learn how to define input features for the model using feature columns, how to pick a pre-made estimator, and how to train it on a small demo data set that fits in memory. Practice with the lab yourself by reading through the notebook comments and executing the code cells. I encourage you to edit the code to ensure you understand what each part does, then come back to the wrap-up video where we'll walk through it together. Note that you have three attempts to complete the lab. So, don't worry if you run out of time on your first attempt.
