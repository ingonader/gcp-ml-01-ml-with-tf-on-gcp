Let's see the code we have so far in action. First, we define here our feature columns, one numeric column for square footage, and one categorical column with the caber list for the property type house, or apartment. We will also have to provide data formatted in the same way. We do this through this training input function here. Our features as defined below, will be square footage. Here is a less list of six species of data. The property type again, a list of six property types, three houses, three apartments. And finally our target labels, which are property prices here in thousands of dollars. Now that we have this training input functions and the feature columns, we are ready to instantiate a linear regressor. That's one of the premade estimators, and start training by calling model.train and passing the training input function as a parameter. You see training happening here, and when it's done, we can try to predict something. So, for that we need a predict input function, which will fit in our features, square footage and type. I define it here and I call model.predict with this predict input function. It gives me a predictions generator. This is a python generator. So, do you actually get value out of it? I have to code next of predictions. Let's do that. And here we go, we have house prices in thousands of dollars.
