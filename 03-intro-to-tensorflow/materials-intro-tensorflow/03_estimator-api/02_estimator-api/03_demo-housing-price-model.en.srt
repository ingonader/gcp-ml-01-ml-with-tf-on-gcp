1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,910
Let's see the code we have so far in action.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,055
First, we define here our feature columns,

3
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:13,060
one numeric column for square footage,

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:21,510
and one categorical column with the caber list for the property type house, or apartment.

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,610
We will also have to provide data formatted in the same way.

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,735
We do this through this training input function here.

7
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:33,600
Our features as defined below,

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,255
will be square footage.

9
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:40,425
Here is a less list of six species of data.

10
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:43,130
The property type again,

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,090
a list of six property types,

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,330
three houses, three apartments.

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,365
And finally our target labels,

14
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:56,015
which are property prices here in thousands of dollars.

15
00:00:56,015 --> 00:01:01,340
Now that we have this training input functions and the feature columns,

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,550
we are ready to instantiate a linear regressor.

17
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,534
That's one of the premade estimators,

18
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,755
and start training by calling

19
00:01:08,755 --> 00:01:13,760
model.train and passing the training input function as a parameter.

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,740
You see training happening here,

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,245
and when it's done,

22
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,080
we can try to predict something.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,300
So, for that we need a predict input function,

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,060
which will fit in our features,

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,740
square footage and type.

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,370
I define it here and I call model.predict with this predict input function.

27
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,965
It gives me a predictions generator.

28
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:44,310
This is a python generator.

29
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,700
So, do you actually get value out of it?

30
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,760
I have to code next of predictions.

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,780
Let's do that. And here we go,

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,110
we have house prices in thousands of dollars.
