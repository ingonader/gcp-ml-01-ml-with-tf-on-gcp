1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
Now, let's talk about checkpoints.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,265
They will be important when you start training larger models.

3
00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:07,980
Why are these important?

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,260
They allow you to continue training,

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,825
resume on failure, and predict from a train model.

6
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:15,450
You get checkpoints for free,

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,655
just specify a folder directory.

8
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:20,160
And let's take a look at the code.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,790
In the previous lesson we trained an estimator by calling

10
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,730
the train function and then predicted house prices by calling the predict function.

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,220
But of course, it is not practical to do this every time,

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,265
especially when training takes a long time.

13
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:38,460
We need a way to save our train model.

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,330
It's called a checkpoint. Checkpoints come as standard,

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,475
when you use the estimator API.

16
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:46,949
Specify a folder, when you instantiate

17
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:50,350
the model and checkpoints will be saved there periodically.

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,680
How'd you restore an estimator from a checkpoint in the same way?

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,369
Specify a folder when you instantiated,

20
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:00,190
if a checkpoint is found there it is loaded,

21
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,175
and the estimator is ready for predictions.

22
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:07,110
Training will also raise you from the latest checkpoint.

23
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,180
This is how you continue training when you

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,780
think that a couple more training steps are necessary.

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,250
If you want to restart from scratch, delete this folder.

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,620
Without any checkpoints to start from,

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,105
the estimator will train from scratch.

28
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:24,630
Please be aware that restarting from the latest checkpoint,

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,360
is the default behavior of estimators.

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,415
This is useful, but you have to remember,

31
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:32,895
to delete the checkpoints directory, to restart training.

32
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:36,190
Especially, when you have changed the model.
