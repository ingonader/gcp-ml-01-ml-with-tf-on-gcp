1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,540
In this lab, you will learn the importance of watching

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,360
your validation matrix while training is in progress.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,335
Before that, we will introduce the estimator train_and_evaluate function,

4
00:00:11,335 --> 00:00:14,645
as well as a new visualization tool TensorBoard.

5
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:19,590
And by the way, train_and_evaluate also implements distributed training.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,450
We are getting that for free.

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,660
Specifically, we'll cover how to use

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,290
train_and_evaluate and how to monitor training using TensorBoard.

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,710
Practice with the lab yourself by reading through

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,320
the notebook commands and executing the code cells.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,930
I encourage you to edit the code to ensure you understand what each part does,

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,800
then come back to the wrap-up video when we'll walk through it together.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,580
Note that you will have three attempts to complete the lab,

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,400
so don't worry if you run out of time on your first attempt.
