In this lab, you will learn the importance of watching your validation matrix while training is in progress. Before that, we will introduce the estimator train_and_evaluate function, as well as a new visualization tool TensorBoard. And by the way, train_and_evaluate also implements distributed training. We are getting that for free. Specifically, we'll cover how to use train_and_evaluate and how to monitor training using TensorBoard. Practice with the lab yourself by reading through the notebook commands and executing the code cells. I encourage you to edit the code to ensure you understand what each part does, then come back to the wrap-up video when we'll walk through it together. Note that you will have three attempts to complete the lab, so don't worry if you run out of time on your first attempt.
