In this lab you will learn how to train on
large datasets that do not fit in memory. TensorFlow has an API called
datasets that can handle this and feed your model while loading the data
from disk in a progressive way. Practice with the lab yourself by reading
through the notebook comments and executing the code cells. I encourage you to edit the code, to
ensure you understand what each one does. Then come back to the wrap up video
when we'll walk through it together. Note that you have three
attempts to complete the lab. So don't worry if you are out
of time on your first attempt.
