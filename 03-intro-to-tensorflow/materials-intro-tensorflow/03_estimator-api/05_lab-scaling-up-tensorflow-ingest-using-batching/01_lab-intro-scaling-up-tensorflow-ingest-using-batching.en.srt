1
00:00:00,606 --> 00:00:06,140
In this lab you will learn how to train on
large datasets that do not fit in memory.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,989
TensorFlow has an API called
datasets that can handle this and

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:14,366
feed your model while loading the data
from disk in a progressive way.

4
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:17,967
Practice with the lab yourself by reading
through the notebook comments and

5
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:19,620
executing the code cells.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,362
I encourage you to edit the code, to
ensure you understand what each one does.

7
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:29,201
Then come back to the wrap up video
when we'll walk through it together.

8
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:31,310
Note that you have three
attempts to complete the lab.

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,550
So don't worry if you are out
of time on your first attempt.
