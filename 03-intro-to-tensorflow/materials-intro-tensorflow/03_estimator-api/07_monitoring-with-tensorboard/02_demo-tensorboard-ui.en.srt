1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,620
I love TensorBoard.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,440
I would not be able to train
a neural network model

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,170
without seeing the relevant training and
evaluation metrics.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,360
That is why I always use estimators and
train and evaluate, and

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,960
follow the training in TensorBoard.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,813
I watch my training and eval loss curves,

7
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:22,622
I watch my activation histograms,
I can see the graph of my model, and

8
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:26,799
many other things including text,
audio, or even images.
