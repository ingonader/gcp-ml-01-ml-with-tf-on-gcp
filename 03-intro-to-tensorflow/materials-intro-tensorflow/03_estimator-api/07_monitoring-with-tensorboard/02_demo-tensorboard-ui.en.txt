I love TensorBoard. I would not be able to train
a neural network model without seeing the relevant training and
evaluation metrics. That is why I always use estimators and
train and evaluate, and follow the training in TensorBoard. I watch my training and eval loss curves, I watch my activation histograms,
I can see the graph of my model, and many other things including text,
audio, or even images.
