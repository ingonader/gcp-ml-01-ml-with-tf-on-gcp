1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
With this, we conclude our tour of the estimator API.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,320
It lets you build models that span from

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,040
small prototypes to large models ready for production.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,980
It's rich set of pre-made estimators lets you experiment with standard models quickly.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,100
And you can also build your own custom estimator.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,980
We will cover that in the later part of this course.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,530
Then, when you are getting serious,

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,230
the API lets you plug in out of memory data-sets into

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,725
its training and evaluate and put functions with the data-set API.

10
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:36,300
Train and evaluate launches a training loop that alternates training and testing,

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,295
so that you can monitor progress in tenser board.

12
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:43,149
It also implements distributed training, and finally,

13
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:46,500
exporters lets you add the glue code needed in

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,275
production and deploy your model behind an auto-scaled fully managed API.

15
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:55,020
There is no rocket science in all of this,

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,285
just hundreds of lines of boilerplate code that TensorFlow provides for you,

17
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:02,460
wrapped in the estimator API,

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,860
so that you can focus on your data and your models.
