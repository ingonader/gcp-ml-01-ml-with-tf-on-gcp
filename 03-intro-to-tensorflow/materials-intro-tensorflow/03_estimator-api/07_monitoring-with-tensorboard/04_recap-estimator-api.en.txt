With this, we conclude our tour of the estimator API. It lets you build models that span from small prototypes to large models ready for production. It's rich set of pre-made estimators lets you experiment with standard models quickly. And you can also build your own custom estimator. We will cover that in the later part of this course. Then, when you are getting serious, the API lets you plug in out of memory data-sets into its training and evaluate and put functions with the data-set API. Train and evaluate launches a training loop that alternates training and testing, so that you can monitor progress in tenser board. It also implements distributed training, and finally, exporters lets you add the glue code needed in production and deploy your model behind an auto-scaled fully managed API. There is no rocket science in all of this, just hundreds of lines of boilerplate code that TensorFlow provides for you, wrapped in the estimator API, so that you can focus on your data and your models.
