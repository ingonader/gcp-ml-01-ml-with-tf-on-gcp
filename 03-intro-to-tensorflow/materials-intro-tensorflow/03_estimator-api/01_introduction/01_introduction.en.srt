Hi, I am Martin Gorner,

2
00:00:02,255 --> 00:00:04,950
a developer advocate for Google Cloud platform.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,090
In this module, I will introduce you to the estimator API.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,015
Estimators let you focus on data science by wrapping your models in a common set of APIs.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,170
Estimators can then implement a host of the boilerplate functionality.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,980
So, that you don't have to write that boilerplate codes.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,324
Real models trained on large datasets,

8
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:28,934
come with their own set of challenges,

9
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:33,585
loading data progressively, distributing the training, monitoring it.

10
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:38,430
All these tasks can become essential when a model trains for days.

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,690
But they are also common,

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,745
across most models and can be provided automatically by the TensorFlow framework.

13
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,310
Let us see how estimators can help.

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,115
In this module, you will learn how to

15
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:54,105
create production-ready machine learning models the easy way,

16
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:57,630
train on large datasets that do not fit in memory,

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,490
and monitor your training metrics in Tensorboard.
