Hi, I am Martin Gorner, a developer advocate for Google Cloud platform. In this module, I will introduce you to the estimator API. Estimators let you focus on data science by wrapping your models in a common set of APIs. Estimators can then implement a host of the boilerplate functionality. So, that you don't have to write that boilerplate codes. Real models trained on large datasets, come with their own set of challenges, loading data progressively, distributing the training, monitoring it. All these tasks can become essential when a model trains for days. But they are also common, across most models and can be provided automatically by the TensorFlow framework. Let us see how estimators can help. In this module, you will learn how to create production-ready machine learning models the easy way, train on large datasets that do not fit in memory, and monitor your training metrics in Tensorboard.
