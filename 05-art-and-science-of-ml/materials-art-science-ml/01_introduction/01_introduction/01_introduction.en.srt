00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
Hi, I'm Fereshteh, a solutions architect at Google.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,345
As a Big Data and Machine Learning Specialist,

3
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:07,950
my job is to help businesses build

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,580
large scale data pipelines based on Google Cloud Platform.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,300
Once they have an abundance of business data available in cloud,

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,240
together with my customers we applying machine learning to discover

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,095
hidden patterns in the data and find answers to interesting business questions.

8
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:26,810
Welcome to the fifth course in this specialization.

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,670
Let us start by quickly recapping where we are.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,925
If you started the journey from the beginning,

11
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:35,570
you'd remember the first mock on course looked into the integral role

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,845
that machine learning played at Google and how we use it internally.

13
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:42,470
If you didn't start from the beginning, it's okay,

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,710
it's your journey, you can enjoy it how it makes sense to you.

15
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,090
In the second course, we launched into

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,800
machine learning by reviewing the history of machine learning and some of

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,470
the fundamental concepts such as how to formulate a problem as a machine learning model,

18
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,200
how to measure the performance of a model,

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,220
how to optimize the training process,

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,725
how to generalize a model so that it can perform

21
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:13,380
well on unseen data and other such fundamentals.

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,020
The third course introduced TensorFlow,

23
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,640
are open source library for numerical computation.

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,400
It's flexible architecture that allows you to deploy

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,700
machine learning models on any hardware,

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,910
and more importantly, distribute the computation among tens,

27
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,665
hundreds or tens of thousands of nodes to tackle problems of any scale.

28
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:38,445
The fourth course was all about feature engineering.

29
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:41,040
We went over tips and tricks on how to apply

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,715
your domain knowledge and manually engineering features.

31
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:47,310
And that brings us to this course,

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,320
The Art and Science of Machine Learning.

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,460
This course consists of six modules.

34
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,274
First, you'll learn about aspects of machine learning that require some intuition,

35
00:01:58,274 --> 00:02:00,570
good judgment, and experimentation.

36
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,870
We call it the art of ML.

37
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,935
We will learn the many knobs and levers involved in training a model.

38
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:12,750
You will manually adjust them to see their effects on model performance.

39
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,620
Once familiar with the knobs and levers,

40
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,915
otherwise known as hyper parameters,

41
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:23,020
in module two you will learn how to tune them in an automatic way.

42
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:29,530
By module three, you'll be ready to spice things up by pinch of science.

43
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,040
And that will save in nicely into modules four when you

44
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,890
will learn the science involved in training neural networks.

45
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:42,610
In module five, you'll learn the important concept of embeddings which is all

46
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,700
about representing discrete objects such as words as real valued vectors.

47
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,084
Up until module six,

48
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:56,145
you'll be working with TensorFlow's pre-built estimators such as DNN Regressor.

49
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:59,720
In module six, you'll take a deep dive into building

50
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,990
your own custom estimators. Ready? Let's get started.
