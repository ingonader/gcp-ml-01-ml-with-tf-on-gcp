Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm a machine learning scientist at Google and I love applying math in machine learning, to Big Data, to better make sense of the world. In this module, I will start to introduce the science along with the art of machine learning. We're first going to talk about how to perform regularisation for sparsity, so that we can have simpler more concise models. Then we're going to talk about logistic regression and learning how to determine performance. At the start of this course, we learned about L2 regularisation and how we can keep the magnitudes of parameter weights small, as well as how learning to write and batch size affect training. Then we talked about how we can perform Hyperparameter tuning, which is an outer automation loop trying to find the hyperparameters that give the best generalize of a model. Now, we're going to add a pinch of science to that art and see how we can perform a different type of regularisation to remove non-productive features as well as some of the details, logistic regression and how we can determine model performance.
