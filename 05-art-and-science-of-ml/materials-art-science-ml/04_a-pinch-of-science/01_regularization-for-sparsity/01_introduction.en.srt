Hi, I'm Ryan.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,910
I'm a machine learning scientist at Google and I love applying math in machine learning,

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,295
to Big Data, to better make sense of the world.

4
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:10,565
In this module, I will start to introduce

5
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:13,290
the science along with the art of machine learning.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,024
We're first going to talk about how to perform regularisation for sparsity,

7
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:19,620
so that we can have simpler more concise models.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,910
Then we're going to talk about

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,365
logistic regression and learning how to determine performance.

10
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:25,745
At the start of this course,

11
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:28,350
we learned about L2 regularisation and how we

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,215
can keep the magnitudes of parameter weights small,

13
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:34,245
as well as how learning to write and batch size affect training.

14
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:37,345
Then we talked about how we can perform Hyperparameter tuning,

15
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:39,710
which is an outer automation loop trying to find

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,045
the hyperparameters that give the best generalize of a model.

17
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:47,235
Now, we're going to add a pinch of science to that art and see how we can perform

18
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:49,410
a different type of regularisation to remove

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,140
non-productive features as well as some of the details,

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,610
logistic regression and how we can determine model performance.
