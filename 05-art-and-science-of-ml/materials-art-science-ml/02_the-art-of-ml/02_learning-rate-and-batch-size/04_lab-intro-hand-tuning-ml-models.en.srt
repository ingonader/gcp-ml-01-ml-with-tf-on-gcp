1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,411
Let's put everything together in a lab.

2
00:00:02,411 --> 00:00:03,225
In this lab,

3
00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:07,602
you will improve model accuracy by
hand tuning the hyper parameters.

4
00:00:07,602 --> 00:00:08,614
In the process,

5
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:12,893
you will learn how to use the linear
regressive class intensive flow.

6
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:16,833
And evaluate the accuracy of
a model's predictions using root

7
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,550
mean square error, RMSE.
