00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
Welcome to the first module in course number five.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,585
In this module, you will learn about the art of machine learning.

3
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:10,860
We will review aspects of machine learning that require intuition, judgment,

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,225
and experimentation to find the right balance and what's good enough. Never perfect.

5
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:16,995
It's all about shades of grey.

6
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:19,725
No black and white fax roots, sorry.

7
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:24,345
You'll learn how to generalize your model using regularization techniques.

8
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:28,080
In previous courses, we discussed the issue of overfitting and underfeeding.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,285
The goal is to generalize a model,

10
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:34,830
so that it performs well on unseen test data not just training data.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,860
Often this comes at the cost of increased training error.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,180
There are many strategies used in the ML to solve this problem.

13
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,100
They are collectively known as regularization.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,980
We will discuss the most common techniques and

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,980
play with them in our favorite Tensorflow playground.

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,980
Then you'll learn about the effects of hyperparameters,

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,595
such as batch size and learning rate on your model performance.

18
00:00:56,595 --> 00:01:00,975
You will manually adjust them in the lab to find the right balance.

19
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:04,050
We will then introduce the rather vast topic of

20
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,300
model optimization and some of the most common algorithms.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,835
You will learn how to specify the optimization methods in your Tensorflow code.

22
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:15,515
We will conclude the module with a lab,

23
00:01:15,515 --> 00:01:17,660
where you get hands on with Tensorflow.

24
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,970
You will manually adjust the knobs and see their effects in action.
