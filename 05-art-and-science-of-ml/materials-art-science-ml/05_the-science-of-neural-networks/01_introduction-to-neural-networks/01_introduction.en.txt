Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm a machine learning scientist at
Google and I love applying math and machine learning to Big data to
make better sense of the world. Now that we have seen the art of
machine learning, in this module, you will now be diving deep into the
science specifically with neural networks and how best to train them. At the start of this course, we learned
about and how it can keep the parameter weights small, as well as how learning
rate and batch size affect training. Then we talked about how we can
perform hyperparameter tuning, which is an outer optimization loop, trying to find the hyperparameters that
give the best generalizable model. We then added a pinch of science to
that art and saw how we can perform and early stopping to create sparse
generalizable models, as well as some of the details of logistic regression and
how it can determine model performance. Now, we will untangle the science
of neural networks and discuss how to train them effectively. Lastly, we'll explore multi-class
neural nets and their uses.
