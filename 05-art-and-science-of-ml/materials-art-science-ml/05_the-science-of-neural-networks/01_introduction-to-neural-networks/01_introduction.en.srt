Hi, I'm Ryan.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,180
I'm a machine learning scientist at
Google and I love applying math and

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,336
machine learning to Big data to
make better sense of the world.

4
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:12,300
Now that we have seen the art of
machine learning, in this module,

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,990
you will now be diving deep into the
science specifically with neural networks

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,580
and how best to train them.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,814
At the start of this course, we learned
about and how it can keep the parameter

8
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:26,150
weights small, as well as how learning
rate and batch size affect training.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,020
Then we talked about how we can
perform hyperparameter tuning,

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,890
which is an outer optimization loop,

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,110
trying to find the hyperparameters that
give the best generalizable model.

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,560
We then added a pinch of science to
that art and saw how we can perform and

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,590
early stopping to create sparse
generalizable models, as well as some

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,450
of the details of logistic regression and
how it can determine model performance.

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,680
Now, we will untangle the science
of neural networks and

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,860
discuss how to train them effectively.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,490
Lastly, we'll explore multi-class
neural nets and their uses.
