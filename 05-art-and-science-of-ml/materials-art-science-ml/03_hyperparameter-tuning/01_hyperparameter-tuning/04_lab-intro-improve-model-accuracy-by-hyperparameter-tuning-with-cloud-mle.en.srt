1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,295
In this lab, you'll put everything we discussed into practice.

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:08,415
You'll turn some hyperparameters into command line arguments.

3
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:11,490
Then you'll add a special evaluation metric

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,225
and make sure your outputs don't clobber each other.

5
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:19,455
And finally, supply the hyperparameters to training job,

6
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,090
and watch it do the magic.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,850
Sounds like a lot of fun. Let's do it.
