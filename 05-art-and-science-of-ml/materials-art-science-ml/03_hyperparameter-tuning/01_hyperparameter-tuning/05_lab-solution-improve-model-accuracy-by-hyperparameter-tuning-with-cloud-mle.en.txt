In this lab we use the MLE engine
to automate the process of hyperparameter tuning. Your goal was to improve the accuracy
of these simple linear regressor that we had built at
the end of module one. I hope you got to do
the challenge exercise and use hyperparameter tuning to
chose the best set of features. There is a lot going on under the hood,
but as you see it's relatively easy to
get ML Engine to do it for you. Although we played with the toy problem, I
hope you appreciate the power of the tool.
