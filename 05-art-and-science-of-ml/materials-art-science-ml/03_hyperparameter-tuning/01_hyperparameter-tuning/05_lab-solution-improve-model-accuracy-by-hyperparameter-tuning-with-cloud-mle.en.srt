00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,880
In this lab we use the MLE engine
to automate the process of

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,900
hyperparameter tuning.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,600
Your goal was to improve the accuracy
of these simple linear regressor

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,480
that we had built at
the end of module one.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,290
I hope you got to do
the challenge exercise and

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,240
use hyperparameter tuning to
chose the best set of features.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,330
There is a lot going on under the hood,
but

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,060
as you see it's relatively easy to
get ML Engine to do it for you.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,840
Although we played with the toy problem, I
hope you appreciate the power of the tool.
