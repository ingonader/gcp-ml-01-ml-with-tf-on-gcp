00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,045
Hello again, welcome to the second module of course number five.

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:08,150
In this module, we will look into Hyperparameter Tuning.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,050
Just to recap, in previous module,

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,775
we talked about the Art of ML.

5
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:17,525
We looked into regularisation and optimization techniques,

6
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:23,165
and learn how our model performance can be sensitive to batch size and learning rate.

7
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:25,330
We experimented with adjusting

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,845
those Hyperparameters manually to improve model performance.

9
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:34,875
In this module, you'll learn how to differentiate between parameters and Hyperparameters.

10
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,320
We will review some of the important ones,

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,865
then we'll discuss traditional grid search approach,

12
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:41,755
and learn how to think beyond that,

13
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:43,595
with the smarter algorithms.

14
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:46,580
Finally, you'll learn how Cloud ML Engine,

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,890
makes it so convenient to automate Hyperparameter Tuning.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,110
Sounds good. Let's get started.
