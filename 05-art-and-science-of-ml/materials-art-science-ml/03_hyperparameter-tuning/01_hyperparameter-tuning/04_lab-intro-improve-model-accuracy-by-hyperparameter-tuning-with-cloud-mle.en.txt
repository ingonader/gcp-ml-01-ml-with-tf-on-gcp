In this lab, you'll put everything we discussed into practice. You'll turn some hyperparameters into command line arguments. Then you'll add a special evaluation metric and make sure your outputs don't clobber each other. And finally, supply the hyperparameters to training job, and watch it do the magic. Sounds like a lot of fun. Let's do it.
