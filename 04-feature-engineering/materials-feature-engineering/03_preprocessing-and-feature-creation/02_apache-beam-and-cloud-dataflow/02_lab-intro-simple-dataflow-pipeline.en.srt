Welcome back.

00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,190
In this lab, you'll take a look at the

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,630
pipeline, implemented using Python and
Apache Beam APIs.

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,710
Next, you will take the code for the
pipeline and first run it locally inside

00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,990
of your cloud shell environment, and then
execute it on the Cloud Dataflow platform.
