00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
Welcome back. Shortly, you will see how to take

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,480
the implementation of this simple pipeline from the previous lab,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,330
and you will add more pipeline features,

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,155
to help you analyze import statements in Java source code files.

5
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:17,730
The pipeline, will use MapReduce type operations to find out

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,165
the top five most popular packages imported by sample Java Source Code.

7
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:25,420
Once the implementation is ready,

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,480
you'll run the pipeline in your cloud shell environment,

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,720
and make sure that you see the pipelines output which is the most popular packages.
