Welcome back. In this lab, you'll take a look at the
source code of a simple data processing pipeline, implemented using Python and
Apache Beam APIs. Next, you will take the code for the
pipeline and first run it locally inside of your cloud shell environment, and then
execute it on the Cloud Dataflow platform.
