Welcome back. Shortly, you will see how to take the implementation of this simple pipeline from the previous lab, and you will add more pipeline features, to help you analyze import statements in Java source code files. The pipeline, will use MapReduce type operations to find out the top five most popular packages imported by sample Java Source Code. Once the implementation is ready, you'll run the pipeline in your cloud shell environment, and make sure that you see the pipelines output which is the most popular packages.
