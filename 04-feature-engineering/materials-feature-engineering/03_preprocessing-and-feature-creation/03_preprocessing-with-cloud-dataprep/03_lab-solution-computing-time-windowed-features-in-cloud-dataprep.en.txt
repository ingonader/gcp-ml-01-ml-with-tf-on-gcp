All right. In the Lab, you learned how to implement your own dataflow job without writing any apache beam code yourself, and using a simple graphical user interface in your browser. You saw that you could explore a complex data set, was millions of rows and create a sophisticated feature, computing a rolling average using a pre-built library of wrangler functions from data parameter. That's it for this module. You learned a lot about doing pre-processing and feature creation. I hope you will get to apply what you learned as part of your future engineering project. Thank you for your time.
