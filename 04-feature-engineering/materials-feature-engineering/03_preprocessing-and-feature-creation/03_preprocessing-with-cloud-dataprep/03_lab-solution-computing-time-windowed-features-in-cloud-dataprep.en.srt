1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,055
All right. In the Lab,

2
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:03,390
you learned how to implement

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,770
your own dataflow job without writing any apache beam code yourself,

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,760
and using a simple graphical user interface in your browser.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,075
You saw that you could explore a complex data set,

6
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:18,435
was millions of rows and create a sophisticated feature,

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,520
computing a rolling average using

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,970
a pre-built library of wrangler functions from data parameter.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,320
That's it for this module. You learned

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,380
a lot about doing pre-processing and feature creation.

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,880
I hope you will get to apply what you learned as part of

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,540
your future engineering project. Thank you for your time.
