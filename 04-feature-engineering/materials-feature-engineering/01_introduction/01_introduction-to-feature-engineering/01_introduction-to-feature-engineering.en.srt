00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Welcome to the fourth course in this specialization.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,170
Let's see what we've covered so far and take a glimpse at what's coming ahead.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,285
Now we move on to how you can improve the accuracy of your ML models.

4
00:00:11,285 --> 00:00:13,250
Here we are going to address two key aspects;

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,185
Feature engineering, and then understanding that art and science of ML.

6
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:19,960
Feature engineering itself is often

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,590
the longest and most difficult phase of building your ML project.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,160
It's in this feature engineering process where you start with your raw data,

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,200
and you combine that with your own domain knowledge

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,210
to ultimately create what we call features,

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,430
that will make your machine learning algorithms work.

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,930
So how do you know whether or not a data feel will be useful inside of your model?

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,640
What are those rules of making a feature good?

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,660
And how can you create new features to further enrich your data set?

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,070
We'll answer these and get real hands on practice creating new features with TensorFlow,

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,220
inside this course on future engineering. So let's get started.
