1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
In this lab, you will use the TensorFlow playground to

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,910
develop an intuitive understanding of the limits of feature process.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,420
So click on this link and launch the training of the job.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,115
Is the model behavior surprising? Be specific.

5
00:00:18,115 --> 00:00:19,510
What's strange?

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,330
What's the issue?

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,060
Now, try removing the cross-product features.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,625
What happens? Does performance improve?

9
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,970
Can you explain what's going on?
