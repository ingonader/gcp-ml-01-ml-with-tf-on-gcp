00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Welcome back. I'm Lak,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,780
and I'm going to be talking about

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,610
an extremely powerful feature engineering technique called Feature Crosses.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,280
In traditional machine learning,

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,820
Feature Crosses don't play much of a role,

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:20,480
but in modern day ML methods Feature Crosses are an invaluable part of your toolkit.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,410
In this model, you will learn how to recognize the kinds of

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,605
problems where feature crosses are a powerful way to help machines learn.

9
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:32,930
And once you learn how to recognize where to use the technique,

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,205
the next step is to learn how to implement feature crosses in tenserflow.

11
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:41,945
Now, your raw data will not contain Feature Crosses,

12
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:44,525
you will have to create them from your raw inputs.

13
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:47,270
So you will then learn how to incorporate

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,255
feature creation as part of the machine learning pipeline.

15
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:54,035
And finally, you will put all these lessons together

16
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:58,720
to improve the taxifare model using Feature Crosses.
