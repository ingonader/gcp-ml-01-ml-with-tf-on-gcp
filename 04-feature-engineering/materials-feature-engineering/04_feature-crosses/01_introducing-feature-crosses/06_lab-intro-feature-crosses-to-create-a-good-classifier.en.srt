1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,960
In this lab you will use
the Tensorflow playground

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,090
to develop an intuitive
understanding of feature crosses.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,110
Click on these links and

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,415
try to add new features while
continuing to use a linear model.

5
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,673
What is the best performance you can get?

6
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,753
Which feature crosses help the most?

7
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:25,673
Does the model output surface
look like a linear model?
