1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,310
In this Lab,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,730
you will apply the lessons learned in
this module to add feature engineering,

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,370
to the basic estimator model we built for
the taxi cab fare prediction problem.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,080
You will see that doing
the feature engineering,

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,487
finally starts to show impact on the RMSC.

6
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:23,340
Specifically, you will learn how to
incorporate feature engineering into

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,430
your pipeline.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,237
You will work with feature columns,
add feature crosses in TensorFlow.

9
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:33,747
And set up a data pipeline that
reads data from BigQuery and

10
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:37,577
creates preprocessed
datasets using Dataflow.

11
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:41,887
On the preprocessed data, you will now
train your more sophisticated model.
