In this Lab, you will apply the lessons learned in
this module to add feature engineering, to the basic estimator model we built for
the taxi cab fare prediction problem. You will see that doing
the feature engineering, finally starts to show impact on the RMSC. Specifically, you will learn how to
incorporate feature engineering into your pipeline. You will work with feature columns,
add feature crosses in TensorFlow. And set up a data pipeline that
reads data from BigQuery and creates preprocessed
datasets using Dataflow. On the preprocessed data, you will now
train your more sophisticated model.
