1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,945
So, stick a quiz again.

2
00:00:01,945 --> 00:00:04,660
Which of these features are numeric?

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,780
Note that non-numeric features can't be used,

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,200
it's just that we need to find a way to represent them in a numeric form.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,630
So, here again, we're trying to predict the number of coupons that

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,280
are going to be used when we looking at

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,130
different features of that different discount coupon.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,360
So, the percent value of the discount,

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,530
for example, say, you have 10 percent off,

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,320
20 percent off, is this numeric? Yeah, sure.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,014
And as a meaningful magnitude,

12
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:34,755
a 20 percent coupon is worth twice as much as a 10 percent discount coupon.

13
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:37,200
So, this is not a problem at all and the percent value is

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,110
a meaningful numeric input as well.

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,720
Now, the size of the coupon, number two.

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,305
Suppose I defined it as four square centimeters, super small,

17
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:48,540
twenty 24 cents, two square centimeters,

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,100
and then 48 square centimeters. Is this numeric?

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,225
Sure and you can relate the different sizes,

20
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:55,815
potentially for the magnitude.

21
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:59,820
But it's also unclear whether or not the magnitudes are meaningful,

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,835
so this was an ad we were placing like a banner ad.

23
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:04,830
Larger ads are typically better and you could

24
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,720
argue that that would make sense for magnitude.

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,800
But if it's a physical coupon like something that goes out in your newspaper,

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,830
then you have to wonder whether or not a 48 square centimeter coupon is

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,445
actually twice as good as the 24 square centimeter coupon.

28
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,355
So, let's change the problem a little bit.

29
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:23,945
Suppose we defined the coupon as small, medium, and large.

30
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:25,530
At this point, are small,

31
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,395
medium, or large numeric?

32
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:29,580
No, not at all. So, look.

33
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,965
I'm not saying they can't have categorical variables

34
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:34,620
as inputs to neural networks, you can.

35
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,450
It's just that you can't use small,

36
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,070
medium, or large directly.

37
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,570
You have to do something smart to them and we'll look at this in a little bit.

38
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,280
So, you just have to find different way to represent them in

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,180
numeric form and we'll take a look at how to do that surely.

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,405
First off, let's take the third.

41
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:52,945
The font of an advertisement,

42
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:58,200
Arial 18, Times New Roman 24, is this numeric?

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,045
No. How do you convert Times New Roman to numeric?

44
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:04,360
Well, you could say that Arial is number one,

45
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,585
Times New Roman is number two,

46
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:06,770
Rubato is number three,

47
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,810
Comic Sans is number four, etc.,

48
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,030
etc., but that's a number code.

49
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,870
They don't have meaningful magnitudes.

50
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,465
If we said Arial is one and Times New Roman is two,

51
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:18,360
Times New Roman isn't twice as good as Arial.

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,505
So, the meaningful magnitude part is really, really important.

53
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:24,925
Next up, the color of the coupon,

54
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:27,155
red, black, blue, green, et cetera.

55
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:28,500
Again, those aren't numeric,

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,720
saying they don't have meaningful magnitudes.

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,660
Now, we could come up with numbers like

58
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,020
an RGB value to make some meaningful numbers or hex codes,

59
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,350
but they're not going to be meaningful numerically.

60
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,319
If I subtract two colors and the difference between them is three,

61
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,510
does that mean if I subtract two other colors,

62
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,480
the difference between them is also three,

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,550
that these two are equal?

64
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,245
No. And that's a problem.

65
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:54,460
Next up, item category,

66
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,805
one for dairy, two for deli,

67
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:58,440
three for canned goods.

68
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,290
No. Again, these are categorical.

69
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,500
It's not numeric.

70
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,065
So again, here, we are not saying that you can't use non-numerical values,

71
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:08,980
we're just saying that we need to do something to

72
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,930
them and we look at things that we'll need to do to them shortly.

73
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,400
So, as an example, suppose you have

74
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,510
words in an NLP or Natural Language Processing system,

75
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,180
and the things that you do to the words to make them numeric is that you could typically

76
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,080
run something like word2vec or word to vector.

77
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,740
It's a very standard technique,

78
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,750
and you basically take your words,

79
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,430
and apply this technique to the word vectors,

80
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,630
so that each word becomes a vector.

81
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,740
And at the end of the word2vec process,

82
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,130
when you look at these vectors,

83
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,370
these vectors are such that if you take the vector from

84
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,980
man and you take the vector from woman,

85
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,890
and you actually subtract them, subtract those words,

86
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,585
the difference that you get is going to be a very similar difference,

87
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:51,815
is if you took the vector for king,

88
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,745
and the vector for queen, and subtracted them.

89
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:57,820
Interesting, right? That's exactly the Word2vec does.

90
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,800
So, changing an input variable that that's not numeric to be numeric,

91
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,010
it's not a simple matter,

92
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,610
it's a lot of work, but it can be done.

93
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,020
Well, you could just go ahead and throw

94
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,975
some random encoding in there like one, two, three, four, five,

95
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:11,690
but your ML model is not to be as good as if you started with

96
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,740
a vector encoding that's nice enough to understand the context of like male,

97
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,990
female, man, woman, king, and queen.

98
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,150
So, that's what we're talking about when we say that you need to have

99
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:24,170
numeric features and they need to have those meaningful magnitudes.

100
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,835
They need to be useful.

101
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:27,280
You need to be able to do eras,

102
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,870
matic operations on them.

103
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,770
You need to find a vector representations in

104
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,630
such a way that these kinds of qualities exist for you.

105
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,720
And one of the ways you can do these things automatically

106
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,095
using processes called auto-encoding or embedding.

107
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:42,780
Or oftentimes, for example, if you're doing natural language processing,

108
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,760
word2vec already exists and you

109
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,140
already have dictionaries that are already available to you.

110
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,410
And more commonly, that's what you'll use.

111
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,740
And when you go ahead, and use one of these dictionaries to take your text,

112
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,850
and convert them into vectors,

113
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,570
you'll go off and use them. No problem.

114
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,340
You won't actually have to build the mapping

115
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,475
yourself for something that's non-numeric into numeric.

116
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:01,465
These things already exists.

117
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:03,700
So, if they don't exist,

118
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,250
you may have to build that yourself.
