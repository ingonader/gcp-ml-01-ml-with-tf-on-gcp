<h3>
 Question 2
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  I want to build a model to predict whether Team A will win its basketball game against Team B. I will train my model on features computed on historical basketball games. One of my features is how many games this season Team A has won.  How should I compute this feature?
 </p>
</co-content>
<form>
 <label>
  <input name="1" type="radio"/>
  <co-content>
   <span>
    Compute num_games_won / num_games_played over the whole season
   </span>
  </co-content>
  <br/>
 </label>
 <label>
  <input name="1" type="radio"/>
  <co-content>
   <span>
    Compute num_games_won / num_games_played until the N-1 th game in order to train with the label for the N th game
   </span>
  </co-content>

<h3>
 Question 3
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  I want to build a model to predict whether Team A will win its basketball game against Team B. Which of these attributes (computed on historical basketball games) are good features?  Assume that these features are all computed appropriately without taking into account non-causal data.
