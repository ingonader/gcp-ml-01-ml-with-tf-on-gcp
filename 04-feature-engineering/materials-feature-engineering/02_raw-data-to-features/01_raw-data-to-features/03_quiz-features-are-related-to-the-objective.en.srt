1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,530
Let's test your knowledge with a quick quiz.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,115
We'll show you some features and give you an objective.

3
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:09,480
And you say whether or not those features are going to be related to that objective,

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,515
and whether or not we should include them or not.

5
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:15,130
Assume that you want to predict the total number of customers who are going to use

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:21,230
a discount coupon for your store which of these features are related to that objective?

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,270
Alright. Let's go through it. Now the font

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,145
to the text in which the discount is advertised,

9
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:31,370
yes or no? Yeah, absolutely.

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,690
The bigger the font is,

11
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,850
the more likely it is to be seen, right?

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,185
And there's also probably difference between Comic Sans or times new roman.

13
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:42,810
Some fonts are inherently more trustworthy than others.

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,470
Comic Sans, I'm looking at you. So, yeah.

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,200
The font of the text in which the discount is advertised,

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,120
that's probably a good feature for us.

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,850
What about the price of the item the coupon applies to?

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,770
Well, you could imagine that people would use a coupon more if the item costs less.

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,690
So, yeah, that could be a feature.

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,960
But notice what I'm doing here.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,040
I'm verbalizing the reason for why it could be a feature,

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,905
am not just saying yes or no just by looking at it.

23
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:10,800
I'm saying yes because people may use a coupon more if

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,965
the item is not highly priced or if it's less expensive.

25
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:16,935
I'm saying yes, people might use a coupon more if they get to see it,

26
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,420
if the font is bigger.

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,070
They need to have a reasonable hypothesis for each and every one of the features,

28
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,880
and that's what makes it ultimately a good feature or not.

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,520
Okay. Next one.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,830
The number of items that you have in stock.

31
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,765
No. How would a customer even know that to begin with.

32
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:36,600
I mean yes, if you had a feature that said "in

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,720
stock versus out-of-stock," that could be a feature.

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,660
But 800 items versus a thousand items in stock? No way.

35
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,720
That's not going to have an effect. So we are going to throw that one out.

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,950
Okay. So, if you like that quiz, here's another.

37
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,375
Predict whether or not the credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.

38
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,705
Whether the cardholder has purchased these items at the store before?

39
00:01:57,705 --> 00:02:00,255
Is that a good feature or not?

40
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:02,790
Well, yes. It could be a feature.

41
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,400
Is this a common purchase for this user or

42
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,795
a completely unfamiliar unlikely occurrence? So, yes.

43
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:12,585
Whether a cardholder has purchased these items at the store before,

44
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:16,910
that's probably a good feature if the transaction was fraudulent or not.

45
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,615
And what about the credit card chip reader speed?

46
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:24,030
Well, what's the hypothetical relationship here?

47
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,095
You don't want to use this as an input feature, throw it out.

48
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:30,000
What are the category of the item being purchased?

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,860
I think fraud. Yeah, well.

50
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,054
There's probably some fraud committed on things like television,

51
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:38,810
where not so much for things like say a T-shirt.

52
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,655
So, you can imagine that there's a big difference between the categories of items.

53
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:44,530
So, the category item could absolutely be

54
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,890
a signal or when they have that B one of our features that we can use in our model.

55
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,185
What about the expiration date of the credit card that's used?

56
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:55,650
Just because we have a data point should it be used as a feature?

57
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,600
Probably not. Maybe the issue date,

58
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,255
because the new credit card experiences more fraud,

59
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:02,120
but not the expiration date of the card.

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,640
Again, we are kind of just talking through and reasoning through these things.
