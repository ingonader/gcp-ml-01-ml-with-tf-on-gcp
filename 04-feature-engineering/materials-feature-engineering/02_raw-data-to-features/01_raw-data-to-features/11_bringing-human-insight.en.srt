1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,375
Lastly, bring your own human insight into the problem.

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:06,000
Recall how we'd always talk through and verbalize what

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,405
our responses for whether or not a feature was good or bad.

4
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:12,960
You need to have your subject matter expertise and your own curious mind

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,760
to think of all the ways the data field could be used as a feature or not.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,040
Remember that feature engineering is not done inside of a vacuum.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,960
After you've trained your first model,

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,500
you can always come back and add or remove features from model number two.
