1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,050
Okay.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,210
The second aspect of a good feature,

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,155
you need to know the value at the time that you're actually predicting.

4
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:09,180
Remember that the whole reason to build

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,840
the machine learning model is so that you can actually predict with it.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,480
If you can't predict with it,

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,320
there's no point in building the machine learning model in the first place.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,720
So, here's one of my favorite things.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,660
A common mistake that a lot of people make is just to look at

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,870
their data warehouse and just take all the data you find in there,

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,130
all the related fields,

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,705
and then throw them all of the model.

13
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:29,445
The machine is going to figure it out, right?

14
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:32,230
So, if you take all these fields use it in a machine learning model,

15
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,560
what happens when you're going to go predict with it?

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,180
Well, it turns out,

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,230
when you go predict with it,

18
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,490
maybe that you discovered that the data inside of your warehouse had, say, sales data.

19
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,680
So, that's going to be an input for our model.

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,230
How many things were sold in the previous day?

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,000
That's going to be an input for our model.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,790
But, here's the rub.

23
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,825
It turns out that the daily sales data actually comes in a month later.

24
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:58,335
It takes some time for the information to come out from your store.

25
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:01,200
And there's a delay in collecting and processing this data.

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,640
And your data warehouse has the information because somebody has already gone through

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,740
the trouble of taking all the data or joining

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,785
all the tables together and putting on an pre-processing in there.

29
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:12,980
But at prediction time,

30
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,810
in real-time, you don't have it.

31
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,220
So, therefore, you can't use it.

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,089
So, some of the information in this data warehouse is known immediately,

33
00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:23,790
and some of the information is not known in real time.

34
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,020
So, if you use this data that's not known at prediction time,

35
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,165
if you use this input to your model,

36
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:33,270
now your whole model is unfortunately useless because you

37
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,570
don't have a numeric value for that input for what your model needs.

38
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,460
Remember again that sales data comes in a month later and

39
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,330
if your machine learning model is using that fuel that comes in a month later,

40
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,895
it's not going to know that at prediction time.

41
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:46,380
So, the key point here is,

42
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,000
make sure that for every input that you're using for your model,

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,550
for every feature, make sure that you have them the actual prediction time.

44
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,360
You want to make sure that those input variables are even available.

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,625
So, you're collecting in a timely manner.

46
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,400
Many cases, you'll have to worry about whether or not it's legal or

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,370
ethical to collect this data at the time that you're doing the prediction.

48
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,080
Sometimes, that's all the information they have available to you and your data warehouse,

49
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,170
but you can't collect it from the user at the time you're trying to do the prediction.

50
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,410
Again, if you can't collect it at the time you're doing prediction,

51
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,725
you can't use it in your ML model.

52
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:20,440
So let's take another example here.

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,770
An easy example to remember is,

54
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,450
say, let's go back to that building,

55
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,400
the housing price prediction model.

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,720
If we simply had today's sale price of the house and the model and data set,

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,420
the model could just output what that price was and be

58
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,360
perfectly accurate during the training data set because there,

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,985
it has this magic data field of house sale price.

60
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,555
But come prediction time,

61
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:45,240
your new houses for sale won't have already been sold,

62
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,890
so your model is useless because you can't feed it what you do not know at prediction.

63
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,750
So, I want us to do a bit of a discussion question.

64
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:00,075
Why is the second field here a bad feature? What could go wrong?

65
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:03,270
As a hint, what happens if the cluster ID was,

66
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,140
say, take it from another model?

67
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,440
What if that model updates without telling you?

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,070
Will you still be able to train or learn anything from your training data set?

69
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,760
Well, the ultimate answer is that

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,975
feature definitions themselves should not change over time,

71
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:20,400
and also, you have to update your model.
