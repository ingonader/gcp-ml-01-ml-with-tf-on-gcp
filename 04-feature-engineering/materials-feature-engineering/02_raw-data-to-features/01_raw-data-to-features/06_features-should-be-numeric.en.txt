So, the third key aspect of a good feature is that all your features have to be numeric and they have to have a meaningful magnitude. Why is that the case? Well, ultimately a neural network is simply an adding, multiplying and a weighing machine. It's just carrying out different arithmetic operations, computing trigonometric functions, algebraic functions on your input variables that you given. So, your inputs better be numbers and those magnitudes better have some meaning.
