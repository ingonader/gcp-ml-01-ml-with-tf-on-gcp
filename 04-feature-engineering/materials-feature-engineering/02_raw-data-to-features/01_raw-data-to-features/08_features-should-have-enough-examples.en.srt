1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
I'm moving on to point number four.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,170
Need to have enough examples of your future value inside of your data set.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,400
And a good rule of thumb that we use and again is just a rule of thumb is that I like

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,825
to have at least five examples of any particular value before I use it in my model.

5
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:17,640
That's five examples of the value inside

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,250
your training data set even before it touches training.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,200
So, what do you mean by that?

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,080
Well, let's take an example.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,310
If you have a purchasing category equal

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,910
to automobile then you have to have enough transactions of

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,640
fraud or no fraud auto purchases

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,570
so you can take a look at fraudulent auto transactions for your model.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,780
If you only have three auto transactions in your data set,

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,965
and all three of them are not fraud,

15
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:44,340
and essentially the model is going to learn that nobody

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,590
can ever commit fraud on auto transactions.

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,450
It makes sense, right? Because you have no auto transactions that are marked as fraud,

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,540
and that's ultimately going to be a huge problem.

19
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,235
So, to avoid having issues like this where you don't have enough examples,

20
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:59,415
notice that I'm not saying that you have to have at least five categories,

21
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:02,160
I'm saying that you have to have at least five samples.

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,020
So, for every value of a particular column you need to have those five examples.

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,100
So, back to our cracked driveway example from our housing model earlier.

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,630
If you believe the photo showing

25
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,255
a cracked driveway should be a good indicator of a housing price,

26
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,300
be sure you have enough samples of

27
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,760
cracked driveway photos for your model to learn and train off of.
