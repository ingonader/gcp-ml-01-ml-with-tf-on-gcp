1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
As we said before, if you can't do

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,010
basic analysis in your data, you can't do machine learning.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,770
So in this topic, we're going to focus exclusively on how to

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,030
create and manipulate features from your raw data.

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,125
Welcome to Feature Engineering,

6
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,730
recall that we said there are three things that you need to

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,190
do to build an effective machine learning model.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,060
First, you need to scale it out to large datasets,

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,480
we just looked at that with Cloud ML.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,735
The second thing you need to do is what's called Feature Engineering.

11
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,320
So in this module, we're going to talk about is how to create

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,540
those good features and how to transform

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,175
your inputs to get them ready for a machine learning model.

14
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:37,630
What we'll also look at is creating synthetic features,

15
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,520
which are features that aren't in your data set originally to begin with,

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,255
but are going to make your model perform a lot better.

17
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:44,715
We'll take a look at this,

18
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:46,740
creating good features, transforming them,

19
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,340
creating synthetic features, together these three things are called preprocessing.

20
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,135
So we'll take a look at how to do preprocessing within the context of Cloud ML,

21
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:56,885
which allow you to do it at scale.

22
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:58,590
After you built a model,

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,575
also look at hyper parameter tuning.

24
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:03,840
It's the way to make these features better in the context of this dataset,

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,770
they are ultimately going to be training against.

26
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,400
So let's first start with how you can turn your raw data into a useful feature vectors,

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,255
that can then be used properly inside your ML models.

28
00:01:13,255 --> 00:01:15,325
So, let's take a problem.

29
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,750
So your end objective is to build a model to predict

30
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,960
the price of a house for a given set of inputs.

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,315
What types of data points would you want to know about this house to begin with?

32
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:28,890
Somebody said things like the square footage of the house,

33
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,555
maybe the size of the land.

34
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:33,225
What about the number of the rooms?

35
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:35,265
Or if it was sold in the past,

36
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:36,980
how much was it sold for?

37
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,540
You've probably already guessed that location, location,

38
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,610
location could be a prime influencer of housing prices.

39
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,895
For me, in the California Bay Area, I'm painfully aware.

40
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:49,245
Wouldn't it be great if your raw data for this housing data is

41
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:52,680
already clean and just the key fields that you need are going to be there?

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,795
Oh, and also, it's in a format that you can just pass in your ML model for training?

43
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:58,410
Well, I hate to break it to you,

44
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,240
it's just never going to be the case.

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,600
Good Feature Engineering, this process that we're going to go through,

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,170
can take an average of 50 to 75 percent of the time that you working on an ML project.

47
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,785
We haven't even started on the ML hour of them side, right?

48
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:12,510
This is just getting the data right,

49
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,385
and it's critical that we do so.

50
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,590
Well, we ultimately want to do here,

51
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,940
shown in a quick example,

52
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,000
got raw data for houses on the left inside of a vector,

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,640
you need to map it to one or more fields in the right,

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,320
in a parallel, this is how we can use it inside of our ML model for training.

55
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,750
So this might look like an easy mapping exercise for some of you.

56
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,660
But wait, how do you even know what features to

57
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,900
use or what makes a good feature in the first place?
