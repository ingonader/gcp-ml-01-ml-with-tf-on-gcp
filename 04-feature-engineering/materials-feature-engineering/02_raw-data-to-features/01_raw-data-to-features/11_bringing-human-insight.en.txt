Lastly, bring your own human insight into the problem. Recall how we'd always talk through and verbalize what our responses for whether or not a feature was good or bad. You need to have your subject matter expertise and your own curious mind to think of all the ways the data field could be used as a feature or not. Remember that feature engineering is not done inside of a vacuum. After you've trained your first model, you can always come back and add or remove features from model number two.
