1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
So, the third key aspect of a good feature is that all your features have to

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,015
be numeric and they have to have a meaningful magnitude. Why is that the case?

3
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:12,390
Well, ultimately a neural network is simply an adding,

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,625
multiplying and a weighing machine.

5
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:17,310
It's just carrying out different arithmetic operations,

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,170
computing trigonometric functions,

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,290
algebraic functions on your input variables that you given.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,140
So, your inputs better be numbers and those magnitudes better have some meaning.
