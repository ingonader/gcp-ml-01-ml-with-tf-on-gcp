1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,265
Moving on to credit cards.

2
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:06,780
First up, whether a cardholder has purchased these items at our store before,

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,160
and again a reminder, this is

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,340
a credit card transaction whether or not it's fraudulent or not.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,560
We don't have enough examples of cardholders who have

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,760
purchased and cardholders who haven't purchased.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,150
Yeah. I mean hopefully if your business is any good,

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,370
you'll have a ton of transactions in your history.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,430
And it doesn't again, it doesn't matter which item, or which store,

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,750
because we're defining in such a way we'll have enough customers who've purchased it,

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,235
and enough customers who have not purchased it.

12
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:31,880
But, suppose we got a hyper specific,

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,775
and we define this as whether or not a cardholder has purchased a bag of diapers between

14
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:39,870
8:30 PM and 9 PM at a specific store number one, two, three.

15
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,600
Now, you can see this is way too specific.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,510
So, it really depends on how we define the problem.

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,940
If you define it general enough such that you have

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,215
enough examples for the good value, then you're in good shape.

19
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:56,640
Next up, the distance between the cardholder's address and your physical storefront.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,985
We have enough examples of customers who say live 10 miles away, yeah sure why not.

21
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:03,485
More 50 miles away,

22
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:05,550
60 miles away, 100 miles away,

23
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,710
may be starting to become a problem,

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,750
you're dealing with scarcity.

25
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,015
So, this is basically where we start grouping things together.

26
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:15,840
You can't use your value as it is.

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,810
So, say you're going to take all the customers that live more than 50 miles away,

28
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,865
and then treat them all together as one group.

29
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:27,980
You're not actually going to take a specific customer who lives 912 miles away,

30
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,140
and use that number in your training data set.

31
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,810
Because I don't know how neural network will happily know that anytime

32
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,590
somebody who comes in from 912 miles away,

33
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,930
it will include them in that larger 50 plus group,

34
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,870
because that one time that this person came in who live far away,

35
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,130
and then used their card,

36
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,590
they didn't commit a fraud.

37
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,370
So, that's basically what you want to avoid.

38
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,760
We're talking about the values of features and not the values of labels.

39
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,700
So, how do you make sure that you do this?

40
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,440
How do you make sure that you have enough examples of a particular value?

41
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,570
Well, the easiest way to do it what a lot of data scientists do,

42
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,680
is you actually plot histograms of your input features.

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,010
And that will give you the frequency of

44
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,855
occurrences for each the different values in your data sets.

45
00:02:06,855 --> 00:02:09,425
You'll practice that a little bit more in your next lab.

46
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:13,820
Okay. Next up, consider the category of the item being purchased.

47
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,740
Absolutely, well, I'm hoping you'll have

48
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,265
more than five examples for each category that you're going to choose.

49
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:22,430
Last up, an online purchase,

50
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,100
or an in-person purchase.

51
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,440
Again, you'll definitely have more examples of these,

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,490
hopefully more than five,

53
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,720
that shouldn't be a problem at all.
