In this lab, we will look at how to use TensorFlow transfrom. We will write a beam pipeline to analyze and transform the training data. And in that same beam pipeline, we'll also transform the evaluation data and we will save the transform function so that we could use it during prediction. We'll modify the training and evaluation input functions to read these pre-processed files. And then we'll train the model as normal. But because we have pre-processed the data, we'll be able to do this pre-processing at scale over very large data sets during training using data flow, and we'll be able to carry out the pre-processing efficiently as part of the model graph in TensorFlow during serving. So this is a way by which you can take advantage of the scale of Cloud doing a pre-processing over multiple CPUs in a very distributed way, and take advantage of the efficiency of CPUs, GPUs and TensorFlow processing units during prediction. So go ahead and open up Qwiklabs and try out this Lab.
