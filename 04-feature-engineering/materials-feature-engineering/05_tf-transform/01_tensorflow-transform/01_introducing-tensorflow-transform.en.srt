00:00:00,422 --> 00:00:02,196
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:03,080
I'm Lak, and

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,040
we were talking about three different
ways to implement feature engineering.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,048
In this module, you will learn how to
implement feature preprocessing and

5
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,840
feature creation using tf.transform.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,825
Using tf.transform will allow us to carry
out feature processing efficiently,

7
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:24,173
at scale and on streaming data.
