Welcome back. I'm Lak, and we were talking about three different
ways to implement feature engineering. In this module, you will learn how to
implement feature preprocessing and feature creation using tf.transform. Using tf.transform will allow us to carry
out feature processing efficiently, at scale and on streaming data.
